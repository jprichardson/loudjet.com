<h1>Announcing MindSpread: Pay-It-Forward for Books</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l30sw9lqQx1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently, I wrote a review of the book
<a href="http://techneur.com/post/550060849/rework">Rework</a>. I asked people to
comment about their favorite business philosophy and I would buy them a
copy of Rework for free. The only stipulation was that they had to give
it to someone else. It was a success. Most people that I communicated
with were enthusiastic about receiving the book and then passing it on.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">business partners and I</a> were at
dinner before the opening event of <a href="http://bigomaha.com">Big Omaha</a>. An
idea emerged. We wanted to start a non-profit called MindSpread. The
mission of MindSpread is to encourage the spreading of knowledge and
culture throughout the world. It could quickly be described as
pay-it-forward for books. We shared this idea at Big Omaha and most
people responded very enthusiastically. Now, we want to share it with
you.</p>
<p>How would MindSpread do this? Simple. We would build a website that
would help each participants visualize their impact upon the world. The
minimum viable product (MVP) would work something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s say that you bought three copies of Rework to give away.
You’ve then given them away to whomever meets your criteria. You get
each of their email addresses.</li>
<li>You go to <a href="http://mindspread.org">mindspread.org</a> and start typing
in Rework. mindspread.org would then leverage Amazon’s book APIs and
as you type the book title in, the textbox input would autocomplete
the rest of the title. Simplicity is key here.</li>
<li>Next there would be a numeric input for you to enter in the number
of copies. For our specific example you would enter in three.</li>
<li>Based on what you input for the number of copies, in this case,
three text inputs appear that prompt you for an email address. You
enter in an email address in each textbox input field.</li>
<li>You then click submit. If you don’t have an account, you would be
prompted to create one via Facebook connect.</li>
<li>The three people who you gave Rework to would receive an email about
MindSpread and the vision. A link would be included in the email for
them to signup and then enter in an email address for the person
they gave the book to.</li>
<li>You would be able to visit your profile page and see a Google Maps
visualization of where your books have been and how many people have
received them. Thus, visualizing your impact upon the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s just the MVP. The possibilities are endless. A ranking system
could be added on books that are spread the quickest and the most books
in the system. A scoring system could be setup for each individual to
see who has the most impact upon the world. You could connect with
people who have interest in similar books that you do.</p>
<p>It is critical that this be a non-profit, as I would like to protect the
sanctity of the site. That is to say, I want to protect its
altruistic nature and encourage giving. I would also like to reassure
people that their email addresses are not going to be used for
commercial aspects. The site could generate money by Amazon affiliate
links.</p>
<p>There is one problem, <del>we don’t have much time</del>, we unfortunately
can’t make this a <a href="http://techneur.com/post/535211849/dont-have-the-time">priority
now</a> to do this
by ourselves. But, we want to see this happen. I in conjunction with
Reflect7 will pay for hosting, initial non-profit registration, and
other misc. costs. I think that to build the MVP, it could be done in a
weekend with a few programmers and a couple of designers. Kind of like
<a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>. I would be more than
willing to set this up and find sponsorship.</p>
<p>Please share your criticism and comments. Will you spare some time to
help with this endeavor? Will you help to spread knowledge and culture
throughout the world? Will you help us change the world?</p>
