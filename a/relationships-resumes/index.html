<h1>Relationships &gt; Resumes</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5hli2XFLC1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I recently spoke with my girlfriend,
<a href="http://kayleeconrad.com/" title="kayleeconrad.com">Kaylee</a>, about the
possibility of her landing a job on the Coast (we live in Lincoln, NE).
She’s a graphic artist and wanted to know if I’d move out there if she
were offered job. My response was a sugar-coated, “Hell no.” I have all
of my family and friends here and I’m in the middle of two start-ups.
Beyond that, if you can’t make your dream job happen here, then why
would the coast change anything? Hell, I don’t want to be on the coasts.
I’ll admit, if I could move my <strong>entire</strong> friend/family network to nice
warm beach, I would. But since I can’t, I don’t want to live in an area
that is so financially over-leveraged.</p>
<p>Instead, Kaylee needs to work on her base at home. What does that
require? Exposure - and I’m not talking about the kind that will get you
locked up. Exposure means getting out of the house. Going to
professional functions and getting involved in your areas of interest.
If you want to make local band sites, start out by asking your friends
if they know a local band. Then, gasp, go see the band play! If you
connect with their message and they need your services then you’re off.
If they don’t have money, do the first job for cheap and tell them you
want free promo space on their site/prints.</p>
<p>The point is to start with your network base and move out. If someone
moves to the coast, they may have a shiny new job but they’ll have to
start all over again. And in this job market, that shine can turn dull
in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Exposure also means staying in the house. Whether it’s blogging,
tweeting, or getting involved in online discussions, get your ideas on
the web. After reading <a href="http://crushitbook.com/" title="crushitbook.com">Crush
It</a>, Kaylee started her blog
roll with 26 gut-busting titles covering a myriad of design topics. With
a little forethought, her blog could be a hit in the next few years.
Then, she’ll be writing her own future instead of relying on corporate
America to notice her. After all, why build on some other business’s
value and not your own? Why compete every year with hundreds of new
graphic design grads who are fresh and willing to scrap? Instead,
compete on something those grads haven’t been able to do: build a brand.
While they were in school, you were out meeting bands and labels. While
they were writing papers, you were writing blog posts and tutorials.
While they were partying, you were partying, but at the right venues
where you could scope out the music scene.</p>
<p>We all know someone who has gotten hired because of someone they knew.
That should be you. Forge the meaningful relationships and it will be.
Remember, an impressive resume can get you a job, but with an impressive
network, you can create your own.</p>
