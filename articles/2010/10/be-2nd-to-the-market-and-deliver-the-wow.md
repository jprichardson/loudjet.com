Be 2nd to the Market and Deliver the Wow
========================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_la8elbsGQc1qzbc4f.jpg)

Since I’m
[moving](http://loudjet.com/a/moving-and-minimalism),
I’ve been scanning my old photos and letters, taking pictures of old
sentimental items, and organizing my digital/real life. I’m really glad
that a service like
[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE3Mzk3NDk) exists. What
would I have done four years ago when Dropbox didn’t exist? Oh wait… I
would have used [iDrive](http://www.idrive.com/) and I did. Why did I
stop using Dropbox and move to iDrive? I don’t really remember the
specifics. But, I do remember at the time while I was using iDrive it
costs \$10 for 10 GB/month. It didn’t work on Linux and it didn’t have
the autosync  feature that Dropbox has. I remember when I first used
Dropbox, it almost felt like magic. There was a ‘wow’ factor.

Consider all of the producers of products that you use today. I’ll bet
that most of them weren’t first to market. Consider Google, iPhone,
Tumblr, Facebook, Honda, etc. These companies were not the first to the
market. But, according to their customers, they deliver a substantially
better experience.

Steve Blank refers to these types of companies as [fast
followers](http://steveblank.com/2010/10/04/why-pioneers-are-the-ones-with-the-arrows-in-their-backs/):

> Why do fast followers win more often?  It’s pretty simple. First
> Movers tend to launch without really fully understanding customer
> problems or the product features that solve those problems. They guess
> at their business model and then do premature, loud and aggressive
> Public Relations hype and early company launches and quickly burn
> through their cash.. This is a great strategy if there’s a bubble
> occuring in your market or you are going to bet it all on flipping
> your company for a sale. Otherwise the jury is in. There’s no
> advantage.
>
> Astute fast-followers recognize that part of Customer Discovery is
> learning from the first-mover by looking at the arrows in their backs.
> Then avoiding them.

Move fast, don’t be first, and deliver the wow. Most importantly, [know
the problem that you
solve](http://loudjet.com/a/google-wave-post-mortem-what-entrepreneurs-can-learn).
