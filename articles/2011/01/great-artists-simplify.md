Great Artists Simplify
======================

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - Leonardo da Vinci

I save all customer emails. After analyzing the emails, it’s clear that
customers only care about a few things:

1.  Most importantly, they want the data to be accurate. If our [sports
    apps](http://reflect7.com/apps) show an incorrect score, our
    customers are pissed. Rightfully so.
2.  They want the data to be up-to-date. We have had problems in the
    past where a game doesn’t get updated for a day or so. Or the NBA
    Cavs app still showed Lebron James on the roster. Ooops. What good
    is the app if the data is not up-to-date?
3.  They want live scores. We originally thought that most people had
    ESPN on their phone and that they could just use that for live
    scores. Maybe they do… but they sure want live scores in our apps.
4.  They want the time to match their timezone. This should have been a
    no brainer from the start for us. There is no reason that we
    couldn’t have delivered this. This has caused our customers to be
    late. This causes them to lose confidence in us. It should.

We are redesigning the entire app. Is a complete redesign necessary?
We’ll see. We are removing the Wikipedia link. We are removing videos
(they were old and crappy Youtube videos). We are removing the stadium
images. We are removing chat.

We are just focusing on fast and accurate data. At least for now.
