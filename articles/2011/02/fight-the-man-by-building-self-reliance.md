Fight the Man by Building Self-Reliance
=======================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg1y13ASiP1qzbc4f.jpg)

I recently read an ~~blog post~~ essay by David of
[Raptitude.com](http://raptitude.com) misappropriately titled: “[How to
Make Trillions of
Dollars](http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/how-to-make-trillions-of-dollars/).”
The title isn’t encouraging us to make trillions of dollars, rather,
it’s describing the massive consumer driven economy that encourages
unhappiness so that we get stuck in a perpetual cycle of consumerism and
how self-reliance is the only way to fight it. It’s well worth the read.
It’s one of the best articles that I’ve read in a long time.

I’ll show my favorite parts:

> > *[Our economy] demands that we make consumption our way of life,
> > that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we

Ah yes, the seeds of consumerism are placed. We see this behavior
everywhere. Fictional character Tyler Durden from the movie Fight Club
said it best:

> Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so
> we can buy shit we don’t need.

David writes…

People watching TV; the epitome of a way that a person can waste time.
I’ve come to despise TV. The sound of it being on represents lost
opportunities.\*

Self-reliance. I believe this is one of the fundamental tenets of
entrepreneurship that motivates us to do what we do. **SELF-RELIANCE**. 

David writes…

> This is not us against them, it’s us for us.

We aren’t fighting a battle. We are doing this for ourselves. Go read
the essay now.

\*I should note that although I hate TV, I do enjoy sports and movies.
I’ll save that rationale for another post.
