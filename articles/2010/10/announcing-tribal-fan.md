Announcing Tribal Fan
=====================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lawfwu0Zmn1qzbc4f.jpg)

I think we might have it. We might have our big idea! It was born last
night. It’s called Tribal Fan. It’s sort of like a sports’ social
network. This idea is going to [marinate for
awhile](http://loudjet.com/a/the-startup-idea-filter).
But, it seems to bring together everything that I felt was lacking
on game days, forums, etc. Ideally, we would deploy this in the summer,
right before the Huskers move to the Big 10.

As it progresses, I’ll announce more.
