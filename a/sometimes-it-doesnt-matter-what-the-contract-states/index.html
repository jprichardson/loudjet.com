<h1>Sometimes It Doesn&#39;t Matter What the Contract States</h1>

<p>Disclaimer: at this time, I can’t write about the details behind the
blog post. I will however in the near future.</p>
<p>Recently, I entered into a negotiation to exchange some software for
cash. That is, I would develop some software and in return, the prospect
would give me cash. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The prospect read over the detailed contract and enthusiastically signed
it. A video of the software working was sent. Positive feedback was
received. The first wire transfer came. All was well. </p>
<p>When the software was delivered, the prospect was disappointed. They
stated that a few things were missing that they didn’t expect to be
missing. Despite the fact that the video showed that these features were
missing and the contract detailed what was included in the software
deliverable, they were still disappointed. It was clear that their
perspective and feelings weren’t malevolent.</p>
<p>I feel as if I’m left with two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquiesce and change the software to meet their expectations.</li>
<li>Adhere to the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both sides have advantages and disadvantages. However, you need to do
what you think is right considering all circumstances. This could be
either #1 or #2.</p>
<p>Think about what you put into your contracts. Do you need to explicitly
point out anything while you’re meeting with your prospects? How can you
make your contracts crystal clear? What could be misinterpreted?</p>
