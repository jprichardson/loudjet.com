<h1>Don&#39;t Let the Brain Prevent You From Your Goals</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh4pua0HX81qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Today is a huge day! New Macbook Pro’s were released! It’s Steve Jobs
Birthday! It’s my five-year anniversary with my fiance! Zomg! To you, my
dear reader, this information may be of little relevance to you. But
what follows is.</p>
<p>This month I’ve set a goal to do
5000 <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/27/the-burpee-the-one-exercise-to-rule-them-all/">burpees</a>.
For you math wienies, that’s just about 180 burpees a day. A burpee is
an exercise where you quickly drop to the ground like you’re going to do
a pushup and then burst into the air like an excited cheerleader. They
really suck; your legs should feel like battery acid was pumped through
them if you do them quickly enough. I have 810 left.</p>
<p>Last week I was hit with a multitude of unexpected problems related to
my various consulting projects. This last weekend I had to attend a
conference from Friday until Sunday afternoon. Early this week I didn’t
feel the best. My typical routine is to go to the gym every morning and
do 300 burpees along with some weight-lifting. I didn’t go into the gym
at all this week, I thought I’d do more at home if I just focused on
burpees. I overslept today, I haven’t done one burpee yet today.</p>
<p>Do you see what’s happening? My brain is making small excuses as to why
I shouldn’t achieve this goal. The brain wants to be comfortable. It
likes to try to tell you why you shouldn’t do a task that will help you
be successful. Your brain is trying to protect you.</p>
<p>Seth Godin call’s it <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html">the
Resistance</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The resistance is the voice in the back of our head telling us to back
off, be careful, go slow, compromise. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next time your brain is trying to prevent you from achieving, force
yourself to persevere.</p>
