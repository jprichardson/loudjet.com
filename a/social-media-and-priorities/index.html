<h1>Social Media and Priorities</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lccg25Lkzt1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you had asked me a year ago if you or your business should be
engaging in social media, I would have responded with a resounding
‘YES!’ I believed that it would give you a ‘leg up’ on your competition.
That you could’ve easily engaged with your customers. That you could’ve
started conversations.</p>
<p>Recently, my <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/changing-schedules-can-force-productivity">schedule has changed
drastically</a>.
I use to go to bed every night around 1 AM to 2 AM and then I would wake
up around 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. I noticed that when I would allow myself
to stay up that late, I would procrastinate my tasks until the end of
the night, sometimes forcing myself to stay up until even 3:00 AM. Now,
I get up around 4:45 AM and go to bed around 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM. But
every weekday, I get up at 4:45 AM. I now feel that more than ever, I
must prioritize my time.</p>
<p>When I look at my Facebook status stream or Twitter feed, I’ve noticed
that most people post pointless shit. The exception on Facebook is, that
I can hide all updates from people that I’m not as close to; also, I may
be a bit more interested in my close friends inane updates.* However,
on Twitter, it feels that 99.9% of the updates from people are
pointless. I doubt many care that you got a flat tire or that you just
bought a super new laser printer. I’ve come to realize that most of
social media is just noise.</p>
<p>I first thought about this after Leo Leparte
<a href="http://leoville.com/buzz-kill">wrote</a> about how no one noticed when he
stopped updating. What does that say? To quote Leo (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes me feel like everything I’ve posted over the past four years
on Twitter, Jaiku, Friendfeed, Plurk, Pownce, and, yes, Google Buzz,
has been an immense waste of time. <strong><em>I was shouting into a vast echo
chamber where no one could hear me because they were too busy shouting
themselves.</em></strong> All this time I’ve been pumping content into the void
like some chatterbox Onan. How humiliating. How demoralizing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally, as I was about to write this, Jonathan Fields <a href="http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/is-twitter-the-ultimate-creation-killer/">wrote
something similar
today</a>.
He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve recently spent a lot of time interviewing some of the most
productive and successful creators on the planet. And, I’ve noticed
something…many hardcore creators aren’t on social media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social media is great for building my tribe, seeding my creations and
fanning the flames once they’re in the real world. It’s great to stay
connected with friends, rant and blow off steam. But, the process of
taking an idea from my head into the world requires intense periods of
focus and action…and in that context, social media seems more
distraction than catalyst, fueled by obsessive fits of
intermittently-reinforced attention-switching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s just it. It’s a distraction. It’s noise. This doesn’t mean that
it can’t be useful. It all comes down to priorities. If you’re trying to
build a small business and you have three hours a night to do it. Where
do you spend your time? Do you write code? Do you respond to customer
emails? Do you Tweet? I see it as an issue of priorities, and at this
time, social media is not one of them.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>*I realize that this is a two-side street as I probably also post
stupid shit to most people.</p>
