<h1>Compete on High-Touch</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4tni8s5gl1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the past few years, I’ve been “consulting” with my cousin about how
he could compete in the Massage Business. Massage Envy is the walmart of
massage places. They’re on every corner in Omaha and compete at the
lowest price spectrum. And that’s the best part - they don’t have
passion or a niche. They’ll do whatever you want, but they’ll do it half
ass. When you serve everybody, you serve nobody.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, we recognized this as a weakness. But how could we
capitalize? By establishing a niche and raising prices. The Muscle
Medics became the place for Pain Relief and the price per hour was \$15
more than Massage Envy. And guess what? It worked. My cousin had a
reputation of passion in the industry and it floated his clientele all
the way to the top. He garnered referral after referral by specifying
his service and drawing a line in the sand against cookie-cutter
massages.</p>
<p>That is what you have to do to compete. You go high-touch. That means
that you interact with every customer as the owner and make sure that
they know what you’re about. One, people will appreciate the personal
service. And two, people will associate a persona with your business.</p>
<p>Unlike Massage Envy, you will have a face. Someone they know who they
can talk to if things go wrong. At larger businesses, there is no
defined head. That makes people weary. How can they trust an
establishment if they don’t know who is running it? When you first start
out, this is the point to compete on. You interact with every customer
so they feel your “touch” and know your brand. They get what you stand
for and where you draw the line. At Brewsky’s Lincoln, I don’t know
where the owner draws the line. But at Randy’s Grill &amp; Chill, I know
Randy, and I know what he does and doesn’t stand for.</p>
<p>So embrace the small startup atmosphere and stand for something. Compete
on personal touch and not price. By doing this, you will establish your
brand and stand out from the crowd.</p>
