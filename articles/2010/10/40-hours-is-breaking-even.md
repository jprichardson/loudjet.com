40 Hours Is Breaking Even
=========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_laydibduts1qzbc4f.jpg)

I read an article yesterday that made a great point. Unfortunately, I
don’t remember the link. But the point was that to get ahead in life you
must put in more than 40 hours. I know, it sounds so simple, but yet so
many people don’t think this way.

Whatever your career is, you must put in more than 40 hours. Maybe you
want a promotion? Maybe you want to build a company? Just remember, 40
hours is breaking even.
