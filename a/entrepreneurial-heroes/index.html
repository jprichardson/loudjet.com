<h1>Entrepreneurial Heroes</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ky8m0pJR751qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I often take inspiration from entrepreneurs who have <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html">made
it</a>. I call
these my entrepreneurial heroes. These men are masters of their craft
and persistent until successful.</p>
<p>I present them to you in the order of influence on my life:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jeff Atwood</strong>: Jeff created blog called <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding
Horror</a>. Since, I’m a software
developer by trade, Jeff’s blog has influenced me in a number of
positive ways. Most importantly though, is convincing me on the
importance of design in software and how it affects the users. My
favorite posts: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/the-peanut-butter-theory-of-user-interface-design.html">Peanut Butter Theory of User Interface
Design</a>,
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/the-sesame-street-presentation-rule.html">The Sesame Street Presentation
Rule</a>,
and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/fail-early-fail-often.html">Fail Early, Fail
Often</a>.
He’s also responsible for creating
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a> - probably my favorite
programming Q&amp;A site. If you’re a software developer, you owe it to
yourself to go back and dig in the CodingHorror’s archive. I promise
it will change the way you think about your design.</li>
<li><strong>Trent Hamm</strong>: Trent created a blog called <a href="http://thesimpledollar.com">The Simple
Dollar</a>. There was a time when I thought
that using a credit card willy nilly was acceptable. Then I hit
<a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/10/31/the-road-to-financial-armageddon-1-the-earliest-mistakes/">financial
armageddon</a>.
I knew that I had to cut back on spending money that I didn’t have.
I searched and searched online until I hit The Simple Dollar. Trent
often writes about personal improvement, focusing on your passion,
and frugality. A must read for any aspiring entrepreneur. Some of my
favorite posts: <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/09/07/the-path-of-least-resistance-is-the-path-without-opportunities/">The Path of Least Resistance is the Path Without
Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/08/28/rule-11-find-and-work-toward-your-true-passions/">Find and Work Towards Your
Passion</a>,
and <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/09/ten-financial-reasons-to-turn-off-your-television-and-ten-things-to-replace-it-with/">10 Financial Reasons to Turn Off the
TV</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mark Cuban</strong>: Let’s see here… you probably know who Mark Cuban is.
If you don’t, well he started out a small PC business repairing PCs,
selling software, and focusing on small businesses. He sold that
business. He then went on to found Broadcast.com. He sold
Broadcast.com to Yahoo for a little over 4 billion dollars. He is
now the outspoken owner of the Dallas Mavericks (NBA). Mark has a
lot of great advice that any entrepreneur should heed. He often
writes on his blog <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/">Blog Maverick</a>. My
favorite posts: <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/04/how-to-get-rich/">How to Get
Rich</a>, Success
&amp; Motivation
<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/23/success-and-motivation-part-1/">1</a>,<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/25/success-and-motivation-part-2/">2</a>,<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2004/05/07/success-and-motivation-part-3/">3</a>,<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2004/05/25/success-and-motivation-p4/">4</a>,
and <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2005/05/30/success-and-motivation-you-only-have-to-be-right-once/">You Only Have to Be Right
Once</a>.</li>
<li><strong>37 Signals</strong> (Jason Fried &amp; David Heinemeier Hansson): These two
guys own 37 Signals, a software company in Chicago that focuses on
creating simple products that <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php">underdo their
competition</a>.
They have a great blog called <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signals vs
Noise</a>. The blog focuses on design of
software, business of software, and other misc. <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2016-unicorns-and-projections">silliness in the
contemporary corporate business
world</a>.
But, if you must read one piece of literature from them, then
“<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php">Getting Real</a>” is what
it needs to be. Do yourself a favor and read it now. In fact, stop
reading this, and just read the damn book. I promise you’ll be glad
you did.</li>
<li><strong>Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>: This post would not be complete without
mentioning <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary</a>. Gary took over his
family’s wine business and took it from just a few million dollars
in a revenue a year to over 50 million. He frequently posts small,
easily digestible inspirational videos on his website. I first heard
of him when I went to <a href="http://blog.reflect7.com/2009/05/16/big-omaha-recap/">Big
Omaha</a> last
year. Here is the
<a href="http://vaynermedia.com/gary-vaynerchuk-keynote-at-big-omaha/">video</a>.
His messages are simple: internet is killing traditional media, care
and you’ll win, anyone can make a living off of their passion.</li>
