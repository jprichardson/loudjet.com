<h1>Don&#39;t Listen to the Techies, Embrace Chrome OS</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldj6afUjjc1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I first heard about Chrome OS, I was ecstatic. I love the idea of
being able to run my apps in the cloud and have them seamlessly sync
with my data without thought. I realize the current practical
limitations, especially for developers. But for the average person that
just wants to surf and write a few papers, would Chrome OS suffice? I
think so. It’s amazing how many times techies will dismiss current
technology trends as solutions in search of a problem. Case in point: as
you probably know, <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html">Cr48
laptops</a> were
just released to testers. Some <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/12/16/0412220/Gmail-Creator-Says-Chrome-OS-Is-As-Good-As-Dead">Slashdot
commenters</a>
have made statements dismissing the utility of such a laptop.</p>
<p><em>gilesjuk</em>
<a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1912550&amp;cid=34572400">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with ChromeOS is it is trying to solve a problem them
doesn’t exist. Why upload data into the cloud if you don’t need to
share it or have access to it on the move?</p>
<p>You don’t want to need to upload all your data to the cloud before you
can do anything with it.</p>
<p>Cloud computing makes sense for people who want to rent computer
processing power on an adhoc basis to solve computational
problems.Computing needs to gradually move to new technologies, it
rarely makes huge leaps. ChromeOS would be better being a full Linux
desktop for now with cloud services instead of being fully cloud
based.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if it were a problem, it’s a problem they’ve solved on all the
other OSes, because you can access the same Google apps on those.
Investing in a ChromeOS machine provides you a set of advantages that
are all present on lots of other machines, with none of those
machines’ other benefits. It’ll have to sell on simplicity itself and
a low device cost if it’s to really work as a product.</p>

<p>The problem with ChromeOS is it is trying to solve a problem them
doesn’t exist.The problem that exists is your Mac, Windows or Linux
box gives you the ability to ‘change’ to some clean state when you
quit your browser.</p>
<p>Google wants to track you from power up to shutdown and Chrome is the
first good attempt in that direction.ChromeOS is like a browser that
never gets its cookies cleaned and reverts to a cookie safe hardware
state on booting.</p>
<p>A huge leap in tracking your habits.</p>

<p>This sentiment isn’t just isolated to Slashdot either. You can find it
on
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/143976/2009/11/chromeos_editorial.html">MacWorld</a>,
<a href="http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/Who-really-needs-a-Chrome-OS-laptop/1292189689">BetaNews</a>,
and

This is not the first time that techies have lambasted up and coming
technology or recently released technology. Consider Rob Malda’s
(founder of Slashdot) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Malda">comment</a>
when the iPod came out: “No wireless, less space than a nomad, lame.”
The iPad was criticized as being just a big iPod Touch. Back, in June <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/steve-jobs-henry-ford">I
wrote a piece on Steve Jobs being a
visionary</a>
similar to that of Henry Ford. I used the iPhone 4 as an example. I
submitted this piece to Reddit and it was criticized.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that you should ignore the techie while building your
business. Unless of course, the techie is your customer.</p>
<p>What do you think of Chrome OS? What do you think of techies’ assessment
of the success of technology?</p>
