<h1>Kevin Rose Took a Risk and Failed</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9e2qyePuM1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Kevin Rose, ex-CEO of Digg, recently made a strategic decision to
radically revamp the way his company operates. In the face of fierce
competition, he felt it was necessary to not rest on his laurels and
take a risk. His risk failed. It failed miserably. His risk was that he
changed the fundamental way that Digg operated - maybe that was the
problem, not sticking to your core. But, who knows… had he have not
taken the risk, Reddit may have continued to gain traffic while Digg
steadily would continue to lose traffic. The new site has some bugs. In
one particular week, the new site contained all of its homepage links to
it’s rival Reddit! Needless to say, <a href="http://socialnews.tumblr.com/post/1191010750/fix-digg">Users are
angry</a>.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, there is an important business lesson to take
away from this. Even better, Seth Godin’s <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/09/the-problem-with-putting-it-all-on-the-line.html">blog post
yesterday</a>
couldn’t have come at a better time: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with putting it all on the line…</p>
<p>is that it might not work out.</p>
<p>The problem with not putting it all on the line is that it will never
(ever) change things for the better.</p>
<p>Not much of a choice, I think. No risk, no art. No art, no reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, you can fail with risk. But fortunately, you can win with
risk. That’s what matters. Taking risk will make you go places. Taking
risk will help you to achieve your dreams.</p>
