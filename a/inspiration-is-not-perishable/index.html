<h1>Inspiration Is Not Perishable.</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2oub6E4bY1qzbc4f.jpg" alt="Inspiration"></p>
<p>(This post was written in response to the situation documented here:
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/learning-pains">Learning Pains</a> -
JP)</p>
<p><a href="http://bigthink.com/jasonfried" title="Jason Fried">Jason Fried’s</a> saying,
“Inspiration is perishable” is a cop out.  Here’s the problem.  With
this mantra in the back of one’s head, it’s way too easy to easy to find
an excuse to not finish a project, or substitute in a new exciting
project.  It’s too easy to give yourself permission to quit.</p>
<p>Inspiration is perishable ONLY IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE.  Or has everybody
forgotten that feeling inspired comes from INSIDE YOU, not from the
outside.  It’s not like it’s some sort of screaming banshee who enters
your body and motivates you to take your next shit.  It’s an internal
locus of control.  You feel a connection so strongly to something that
you are motivated to the task. </p>
<p>Two people can listen to the same speech and have two different
reactions.  One can be inspired and the other agnostic.  What does that
tell you?  That inspiration, much like motivation, is an internal force
that can be stimulated externally or internally.  And you bet your ass
I’ll pick the guy for my team with the internal stimulus over the
external one any day.\
\
When people tell me that they want to act on their inspiration right
now, I think great.  But if it gets in the way of their original
project, I think that they can’t control their motivation well enough to
execute their original goals.  Do they have to be constantly inspired to
finish?  What happens when their motivation for the new project runs out
because of unforseeable complications?  Will they still finish?  It’s
the last 10% of execution that matters most.  Without it, you have an
incomplete project.  Read the caption above, “Genius is 1% inspiration
and 99% perspiration…” Same goes for execution.\
\
Now I get the part about acting on inspiration right when you feel it. 
Sure, when you’re all reved up about something, you can channel that
energy into a project.  I’m doing that right now with this post.  But
don’t let inspiration conjure up new distractions.  I get inspired a
lot, but as my collegue JP once told me, “Don’t mistake passion for
priority.”  Our company, Reflect7 has done this a few times and we’re
about to do it again.  If I were to act everytime I get inspired, I’d
get no where.  A sort of inspirational A.D.D. where I would switch from
one project to another.  Inspiration can motivate, but if it’s your only
motivation then good luck finishing something.\
\
I hear the points, “If our hearts arn’t in it anymore, the project will
suffer.”  OK, get your heart back into it.  Realize why you came up with
that project in the first place.  At some point, you were inspired to do
that project.  Maybe you wanted to bootstrap your company.  That’s why
we started our iphone sports apps.  Just because that goal is not saving
the world, doesn’t mean it’s not worth the effort.  In fact, if you want
to help the world, bootstrapping your company may be the most important
step to acheiving that goal.  Then you free up your time to work on
projects that fulfill your purpose.  Which brings me to the title of my
next blog post, “Legacy does not equal purpose.”  But we’ll save that
for tomorrow.</p>
<p>So don’t worry so much about being inspired.  Think about all of the
small goals you need to accomplish to fulfill your large goal.  Then
think about why that large goal is important to you and the world. 
Think about the happiness you’ll feel when you accomplish it.  Take the
thought process out 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, until your on your
death bed looking back with no regrets.  Now think about all of the
negative consequences if you don’t follow your goal.  Think about it
after 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and after living a life of regret. 
Do this and you’ll find yourself motivated again and you’ll know that
Inspiration Is Not Perishable.</p>
