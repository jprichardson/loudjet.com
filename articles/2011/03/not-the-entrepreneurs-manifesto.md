Not the Entrepreneur's Manifesto
================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhgrvgFJga1qzbc4f.jpg)

Did you ever read the [Hacker’s
Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto)? If not, you
can read it [here](http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/manifesto.html),
[here](http://www.technozen.com/manifesto.htm), and
[here](http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&id=3#article). I
thought it made sense to link to it more than once just in case you read
this post years later and one of the links is dead. I remember when I
first read it. It was almost 12 years ago. It sent chills down my spine.
It made me feel like I was part of something special, something that
just transcended my everyday life.

A piece of literature circulated today that caught my eye. It’s titled:
[Someone is Stealing Your
Life](http://www.lycaeum.org/mv/M2/ventura.html). You should read it. I
read the first few paragraphs, it felt like he was building a case for
entrepreneurship. I was blinded by my open enthusiasm by how it made me
feel. I thought this literary piece was going to turn out to be like the
Hacker’s Manifesto. I thought it was the Entrepreneur’s Manifesto. And
then I got mid-way through… and realized that the whole entire essay is
a self-defeating piece of garbage.

**You have a *choice*.** 

You can work for someone else, or you can work for yourself. You can
reduce your expenditures. You can opt to use your free time to learn or
build a business.

But you have a choice. Don’t ever let yourself believe otherwise, you’ll
only set yourself up for failure.
