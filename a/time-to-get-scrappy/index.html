<h1>It&#39;s Time to Get Scrappy</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2wagayl1x1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Two of my <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/entrepreneurial-heroes">entrepreneurial
heros</a> have
given me some advice. <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynernchuk</a>
said at <a href="http://bigomaha.com">Big Omaha</a> that it’s time to get scrappy.
Do it what it takes. <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason Fried</a>
advised entrepreneurs to sell their by products in the book
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/rework">Rework</a>. So, I’m listening
to the both of them.</p>
<p>About four years ago, I was working with incredibly large
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> files. Some
of them were as big as 64 GB! At times I needed to sort them to make my
analysis a bit quicker. I needed to sort them by date, IP address,
number, etc. So, I did what any good software hacker would do, I wrote a
simple tool to do this.</p>
<p>I haven’t had much of a need for it lately, but after thinking a bit
about Gary and Jason’s advice, I figured it made sense to find out if
anyone else had this need. Plus, I had a \$100 coupon for
<a href="http://adwords.google.com">AdWords</a>… so it made sense to give it a
shot.</p>
<p>Here’s what I needed to do:\
1) Register a domain.\
2) Setup a simple website.\
3) Create the AdWords campaign.</p>
<p>I registered <a href="http://csvsorter.com">csvsorter.com</a> from
<a href="http://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. I’ve been using Namecheap for about
three years now and love their service. They are a bit more expensive
than GoDaddy, but their service is so much better! I then grabbed a
<a href="http://templates.arcsin.se/">template</a> and modified it to my liking. I
wasn’t sure how I would solicit feedback though on the website. I just
wanted someone to be able to enter in their email address and maybe a
bit about problems they face when dealing with CSVs. I knew about
<a href="http://wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a>, but I didn’t want to pay for a service that
I might not be using indefinitely. That’s when I remembered <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=87809">Google
Forms</a>.
Google Forms is one of the most underrated utilities in Google Docs! You
can create a survey/form and embed it on your website; when you get a
response, it autoupdates a Google Spreadsheet! Very cool! I then created
the AdWords campaign - I was set!</p>
<p>I didn’t post the actual product on the website, as I’m not sure there
will be much demand. To get the product in a commercial state will take
a bit more work. I’ll have to create an install package and some simple
registration mechanism. I thought it might make sense to assess demand
and perhaps follow Steve Blank’s <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation">Customer Development
Model</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, this took maybe two hours. Will this work? I have no idea.
Maybe Excel can sort large CSV files now? I know back when I wrote this,
Excel had a spreadsheet limit of approximately 65k lines. I know that
has changed, but can Excel sort 16mm lines?</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts, questions, or feedback on
<a href="http://csvsorter.com">csvsorter.com</a> or on this post, I would love to
know.</p>
