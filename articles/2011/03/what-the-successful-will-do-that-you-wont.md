What the Successful Will Do that You Won't
==========================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li5r4oBDr21qzbc4f.jpg)

Watch this short Stephen Colbert interview of Mark Cuban:

Did you catch the part about how Mark Cuban sold milk powder door to
door? According to [his Wikipedia
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban), he’s sold garbage bags,
stamps, and even started a chain letter that netted him over \$1000.
Richard Branson [sold magazines out of the trunk of his
car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson). [Felix Dennis
started a small magazine on Bruce
Lee](http://www.felixdennis.com/about/dennis-publishing/) eventually
building the publishing empire behind Maxim, Blender, and The Weekly.
Gary Vaynerchuk s[old baseball cards and operated a bunch of lemonade
stands](http://www.phare-conference.eu/programme/gary-vaynerchuk/).
Steve Jobs [returned Coke bottles for
money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)!

Sebastian Marshall calls this the [“knack for getting money” or
“hustling”](http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/the-knack-for-getting-money).
He uses 50 Cent as an example:

> Look at 50 Cent – he’s sold around 40 million records… I don’t know
> what his cut is per album sold, but he probably made more money from
> the Glaceau Vitamin Water deal than he has from records.
>
> He’s got skills, he’s got drive, and he works hard. But lots of
> musicians have skill, drive, and work hard. What sets him apart is
> that 50′s got no hangups about getting money.

Most of these odd money-making methods were done out of desperation and
necessity, with the exception of 50 Cent of course. But that’s just
it. The successful don’t have hangups about making money. They’ll just
do it without thinking about it.

You can become good at making money too. It just takes practice. Jason
Fried founder of 37Signals wrote an article in Inc magazine on [how to
get good at making
money](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried.html):

> So here’s a great way to practice making money: Buy and sell the same
> thing over and over on Craigslist or eBay. Seriously.

> An iPod is a good test. Buy it, and then immediately resell it. Then
> buy it again. Each time, try selling it for more than you paid for it.
> See how far you can push it. See how much profit you can make off 10
