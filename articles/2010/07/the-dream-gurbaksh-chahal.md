The Dream: How Gurbaksh Chahal Made Over 100 Million Dollars

I first heard of Gurbaksh Chahal (“G” as he likes to be called) on
[Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/gurbaksh-chahal). I was intrigued by his
success for two reasons. First, he made his fortune in the advertising
industry. I’ve mentioned my desire to tackle the mobile ad industry and
G’s success story is something that I can learn from. Second, he
completely bootstrapped his first company.

I started following [him on Twitter](http://twitter.com/gchahal) and he
would occasionally tweet about his book. I was hesitant to read it
because I wasn’t sure that I would connect with him. I knew that he was
telling his story, but I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to relate
with his Indian heritage and his upbringing. That was naive thinking. I
was able to connect with the story from one entrepreneur to another
because of his perseverance and his struggles.

The story starts out with G describing his Indian childhood. His parents
were awarded a Visa via the lottery system. When G was four, he and his
family came to America with \$25. He was often tormented as a child
because of his turban. When he was an early teen his father took him
back to India so that he wouldn’t forget his heritage. They first met
some cousins on his mother’s side. G comments how he felt no connection
to his cousins, it was as if his cousins thought he was the dumb
American and they were the smart indians. He then went to visit his
grandmother’s sister and he said she and everyone in the village was
very welcoming. He then states his first lesson: “Always surround
yourself with people who want you to succeed, as you will discover most
people are rooting for you to fail.”

He often interjects with lessons that he’s learned. On top of his
engaging story, these lessons make the book a bargain. He next describes
his early teen years and how he started to develop a passion for helping
his father with stock research. He likened it like homework, except for
the real world. On October 27th, 1997 the stock market crashed. His
father had lost everything. This was the first time G saw his farther
cry. G was terrified. A few days later his father snapped out of his
depression and was determined for his family to move into the house they
had been saving for. G was affected by the positive change in attitude.
The resilience and determination was cemented into his way of thinking.
His next lesson: “Never give up. The road to success is paved with
failures.”

G and his family started to try to find ways that each could contribute.
G applied at a local McDonalds. The manager sat down with him and asked
him a few questions. G felt as if the manager didn’t want him to work
there because of his appearance. The manager told him that they had just
hired a bunch of people. The “Now Hiring” sign never came down. G felt
rejected. He knew that someday “he would be his own man, run his own
show.”

In, 1998 G knew that high school wasn’t for him. He transferred to an
accelerated middle college program. Here he took every opportunity to
challenge himself. He signed up for a public speaking class and
delivered a great speech on Viagra. He did a paper on Socrates and
quoted Socrates twice:

> Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs, therefore
> avoid undue elation in prosperity and undue depression in adversity.
>
> By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you’ll be happy. If you
> get a bad one, you’ll become a philosopher.

**Advertising**

He noticed that money started flowing from traditional media such as
newspaper and TV to the internet. He noticed that there were other
companies that were cashing in on this. He also noticed that companies
were starting to transition from impression-based ads to click-based, as
it gave advertisers to monitor performance of the ads. G wanted to try
to learn more about this and so he started calling around. As an
introvert, he had to practice his pitch.

> Hello, my name is Gary Singh and I do performance-based advertising. I
> have a web site and I would like to know a little about your
> operation.

He told potential clients that he was “Gary Singh” to sound a bit more
American.

**Bootstrapping**

G had a web site, but it was amateurish - he had designed it in
Microsoft FrontPage. He found a company in London that had an Ad
tracking system. A company rep flew out to meet G. Since G didn’t have a
driver’s license, his brother drove him to the dinner meeting. He found
out that the company rep was the owner and the company was a one-man
operation who was on the verge of bankruptcy. G instantly knew that he
was negotiating from a position of power and was no longer nervous. The
man tweaked the software to G’s needs and G bought the software for
\$30k. The agreement stated that G would pay him after 90 days. G needed
90 days to generate income. G also told him that once the company was up
and running, he would offer to pay the man \$10k a month to operate the
software. G was instantly and business and quickly registered the name
“Click Agents.” 

G started making more calls. He started emailing. G said that getting
people on the phone was a “piece of cake.” But finding someone to take a
chance on him was difficult. In his pitch, he claimed that he had a
consortium of web sites that he could place ads on a per-click basis.
When in fact, he didn’t have a consortium. He had to just convince his
potential clients that he could deliver. Finally, G struck gold when he
called LeftField and ad agency who had InfoSeek as client. InfoSeek
wanted to increase traffic to their site. G told LeftField that if they
would put up a \$30,000 order he would deliver traffic for \$1 a click.
The following morning they sent over an order.

This book is all about G’s ability to perservere. That’s the big lesson;
that’s what made him succeed. Whether he was battling his cultural
traditions, his parents expectations, his business adversaries, or VCs,
G was able to persevere - and his ability to persevere made him
successful.

**Conclusion**

This book is a must read for any entrepreneur. It’s more than just a
story, as G explicitly notes his lesson for the reader. I want to
conclude with some more lessons that stood out to me:

1.  People think that in order to succeed in business you must have a
    new radical idea. In reality, you can be very similar to the
    competition as long as you have the right people, the right
    leadership, and you are ***committed to being better*** than the
    best.
2.  Never do anything solely for money. If you do, your decisions will
    be blinded by greed.
3.  Own your mistakes.
4.  Be frugal, but don’t be cheap. Pay good money for good people,
    forget the fancy furniture.
5.  Don’t chase the money, chase substance. If you have substance, the
    money will follow.
6.  Adjust your attitude. Without the right attitude, you’ll never
    succeed. You have to believe in yourself, because no one else will.
7.  Learn to listen. Listen more to the people you disagree with.
8.  Never compromise your morality.
9.  Don’t procrastinate, procrastination is another word for wanting to
    fail.
10. Don’t do anything by half-measures. Remember, mediocrity is for
    losers.

I had trouble picking only 10 lessons. Overall, this book is jam packed
with at least 50 lessons. If you are wanting to bootstrap a company, you
must read this book.

In the vein of
[MindSpread](http://loudjet.com/a/announcing-mindspread),
I will ~~be giving a copy away~~. **Contest closed.**

1.  You must comment on an an entrepreneur you know or have read about
    that has bootstrapped a company. Can be anyone. Tell the story.
2.  You must have a US address.
3.  You must have never have met me or anyone from Reflect7 personally.
4.  After you are done reading the book, you must promise to give it
    someone else. You must then instruct this person to do the same, and
    so on.
5.  You must be one of the first five commenters. One will be randomly
    chosen.
