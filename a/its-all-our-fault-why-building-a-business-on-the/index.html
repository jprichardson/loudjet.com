<p><strong>Update at the bottom.</strong></p>
<p>Recently, my business partner <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Brian</a>
wrote an
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/iphone-company-struggle-1">article</a>
about us promoting an app on Apple’s App Store. One of our strategies
was to leverage our existing customers of our NBA apps to promote <a href="http://finalmadness.com">Final
Madness</a>. We had done this with our NCAA
basketball apps, and it worked great - in two days, the app made it to
#13 in the sports section of the US iTunes store. We had submitted our
revised NBA apps to Apple for approval over this weekend. Our thought
was that they would be approved by Monday or Tuesday. We thought this
would provide enough momentum for the Final Madness to stay in the top
#25 until Selection Sunday.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, Apple sent an email. The email notified us that the
application review state has changed. Typically, this is done to
indicate that the reviewer is unsure about something and needs someone
with higher authority to make a decision. In the past, Apple has called
us when this would happen. Not this time. After I read the email I was
feeling a bit bitter towards Apple. Internally, I was blaming them for
this problem. I thought, Why can’t they just accept it as they usually
do? Why do they have to go through this annoying review process? I just
so happened to stumble upon an article entitled: <a href="http://www.marksonland.com/2010/03/note_to_entrpreneurs_its_your_1.html">Note to Entrpreneur’s:
It’s Your
Fault</a>.
The premise of the article is that everything that happens to your
business is your fault in one way or another.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the article writes:</p>
<p>“The real trick is not to give the “it’s my fault” attitude lip service,
but to actually believe it and live it. Never let your guard down. No
whispering to friends/ family that “if only so and so did this” or “if
only that hadn’t happened….” Always blame yourself. Its the only way
your problems get solved.”</p>
<p>The article is right. We knew about Apple’s developer agreement. Yet, we
decided to look the other way.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, I had finally received the following email from
Apple:</p>
<p>Dear Reflect7,\
\
 Thank you for submitting your family of fan applications to the App
Store.  We’ve reviewed your applications and determined that we cannot
post them because they appear to contain features, namely,content and
feeds, that bear resemblance to well-known third-parties including The
New York Times, LA Times and CBS Sports.\
\
 Additionally, we determined that we cannot post these versions of your
iPhone application to the App Store at this time because of
inappropriate ‘Keywords’ used to identify your application.
 Applications that contain terms, product names, brand names, or
entities in their search criteria that are registered trademarks not
licensed or owned by the submitter cannot be posted to the App Store.
 It would be appropriate to remove nba, nba team and NBA.\
\
 Please remember that pursuant to your agreement with Apple, you
represent and warrant that your application does not infringe the rights
of another party, and that you are responsible for any liability to
Apple because of a claim that your application infringes another party’s
rights.  Moreover, we may reject or remove your application for any
reason, in our sole discretion.\
\
 Please provide documentary evidence that you have the rights to use
this content to ensure compliance with the iPhone Developer Program
License Agreement. Once Legal has reviewed your documentation and
confirms its validity, we will proceed with your application review. Be
aware that while your iTunes Connect Application State is displayed as
Rejected, it is not necessary to upload a new binary in this particular
case.  However, if your application is not in compliance, and you are
able to make the necessary changes, we encourage you to do so and
resubmit your binary for review.\
\
 Regards,\
\
 iPhone Developer Program</p>
<p>The bomb dropped. The applications that the email is referring to have
been in the App Store for over two months now. Why weren’t these
problems flagged earlier? From the text of this email, it would indicate
that Apple has problems with applications using RSS feeds to link to
well known news sources. That pretty much describes all of our Sports
Fan applications. Our bootstrapping strategy was over - and it’s all our
fault. As I said earlier, I knew that Apple held the keys to their
kingdom. I understand that they are well within their rights to control
what is on their store and what isn’t. I agree with all of it. The
inconsistency of the review process bothers me, but yet again, it’s done
by humans. Humans are inconsistent creatures. One app reviewer may
interpret a policy different than another. However, it is still our
fault.</p>
<p><strong>Why You Shouldn’t Build Your Business on the App Store</strong></p>
<p>I’m not saying that you should stop developing your iPhone apps. What I
am saying, is that if you are attempting to build your business off of
the App Store you are putting a major liability on your company.
Recently, the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all">EFF</a>
requested the Apple Developer Agreement from NASA on the FOIA. Read it,
and then read it again.</p>
<p>Mark Suster, entrepreneur turned VC, wrote an article: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/02/17/app-is-crap-why-apple-is-bad-for-your-health/">App is
Crap</a>.
One of his finest points in the essay is that Apple is a channel and not
a business model. Mark writes:</p>
<p>“I see too many companies that are building iPhone App companies.
 iPhone is not a business model unless you’re Apple.  It’s a channel.
 It’s a way to reach your customers.  And single channel businesses are
vulnerable to the vagrancies of the market place.  If you’re a “pure
mobile” company that’s fine.  There is a strategy for that.  But you
need to think in terms of broader distribution.”</p>
<p>I think he is spot on. It’s too bad we didn’t focus on this earlier.
But, yet we are young, nimble, and hungry entrepreneurs and so we
didn’t. Now we know.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">wise man</a> once said:
“Stay hungry, stay foolish.” Perhaps he meant that literally?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2010-03-12 10:40 CST:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Many people have asked if we are ‘giving up.’ We are not. We are
just changing strategies. My main point still stands, it’s foolish
to build a business on the Apple App store.</li>
<li>To my knowledge, there is no trademark infringement against the NBA.
The trademarked word “NBA” is not used anywhere in the application
in content that we own. Nor is it used to promote the app. In fact,
our description clearly claims that we are not associated with the
NBA. </li>
<li>I’m not sure what happened to all of the comments. They show up in
my Disqus profile, but they are not visible here. I’m looking into
this.</li>
