<h1>Make Small Deposits Into the Bank of Success</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_let9liy2RI1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You’ve undoubtedly heard about the emotional roller coaster that
entrepreneurship has associated with it. One day you look at your sales
sheet and sales are up 250%; time to pop the bottles of champagne! Three
weeks later your sales are down 300%; you start to question whether what
you’re doing even matters. In short, at times entrepreneurship is
wonderful, at times it sucks and you want to pull your hair out.</p>
<p>I’m coming to the realization that to be successful in business, at the
<strong><em>very least</em></strong>, you need to be focused, committed, and motivated.
That’s just the required minimum.</p>
<p>One technique that I think can help to keep you motivated is to consider
your large goal as the “bank of success.” It’s possible to make
withdrawals and deposits into this bank. It’s imperative to have metrics
for this bank of success. Let’s say that your bank of success is related
to fitness. Putting a deposit into this bank might be lifting weights or
running. Taking a withdrawal might be eating McDonalds. The metric might
be your weight or body-fat percentage. Your bank of success could also
be your business. A deposit might be writing some code, contacting an
important customer, or creating a marketing campaign. A withdrawal might
be doing something else with your time where you could be making
deposits. Your metrics might be your sales numbers, website hits, or
profits. It doesn’t matter. What matters in the mindset of thinking that
each action you do can either be a small deposit into the bank of
success or a small withdrawal. But developing this mindset should help
to keep you motivated and focused.</p>
