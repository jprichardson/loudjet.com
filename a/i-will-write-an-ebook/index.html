<h1>I Will Write an Ebook</h1>
<p>I’m planning on writing an ebook! The ebook will be about picking up
women. Just kidding, I’m not one of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_artist">those</a>.</p>
<p>Awhile back, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405739/mvvm-tutorial-from-start-to-finish">I asked a question on
Stackoverflow</a>
regarding tutorials for C# developers who currently use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms">Windows
Forms</a> and want to make the
switch to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF/Silverlight</a>
using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM design
pattern</a>. I have been
working with WPF/MVVM for a little over a year and have become adept at
it.</p>
<p>Why would I want to write an ebook?</p>
<ol>
<li>I have never written an ebook. This represents a new and exciting
challenge for me.</li>
<li>This will improve my writing ability. I’ve been blogging almost
every weekday for about 9 months. It feels like a chore at times.
But I believe that writing and public speaking are two of the
best <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/05/19/the-power-of-transferrable-skills-and-six-areas-to-work-on/">transferable skills</a>
that a person can have. To create an ebook that people will feel is
worth reading will take a lot of work and research and thus, improve
my writing.</li>
<li>I want to give back to the community. I will take the same approach
as 37 Signals for their book <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting
Real</a>. You’ll be able to read the
book for free online. If you want a downloadable PDF, it’ll cost a
small fee.</li>
<li>I will potentially make some extra money. I doubt it’ll be much
though, as that’s not the primary motivator.</li>
</ol>
<p>How will I market it? If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=mvvm+tutorial">Google “MVVM
Tutorial”</a>,
my question is the first hit. I’ll be able to add my ebook as an answer
or edit the top answer. This should provide significant amount of
traffic for the book to get noticed. This might be all that I have to
do. It might also be naive thinking. We’ll see.</p>
<p>The major show stopper is time. Ehem…
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/dont-have-the-time">priority</a>. I
have a lot on my plate that shifts the priority of this down my to-do
list. I would anticipate that this may take me at least a year.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
