<h1>What Monopoly Can Teach Us About Business</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l69bvfhTeu1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When I was growing up, there was no gay-ass farmville. We wouldn’t water
each other’s virtual garden or sniff each other’s virtual ass. We’d play
the game with the opponent right there and we’d laugh in their face if
they lost. Just like asking a girl out, I was usually at the receiving
end of the laughter.</p>
<p>When it came to Monopoly, I still have nightmares of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Uncle_Pennybags">Uncle
Pennybags</a> ransacking
my mattress for those golden Five-Hundreds. Besides the game taking four
hours to play, I just didn’t have the patience to secure the key
properties. I bought the first decent place I landed on, fearing that
I’d roll worse next turn. My spaces usually ended up scattered around
the board. I’d even settle for the lowly Vermont, Connecticut, or
Oriental Avenue. You know, the light blue properties between the
Railroad and Jail. Talk about a shitty neighborhood. Basically, I was a
slum lord.</p>
<p>One of my older friends, Mike, was always able to administer the Park
Place-Boardwalk combo beatdown. He’d go to great lengths to secure these
properties. Then, he’d beef them up with housing and hotels. Word to the
wise, when someone calls rent on you for landing on a Pimped-out Park
Place right after you snake-eyed it from their Boardwalk hotel, they’re
really saying, “Would you please end the game by violently flipping over
the board over?” As any good friend would, I happily obliged.</p>
<p>But this story isn’t about how many monopoly boards ended up in the
ceiling fan, it’s about Mike’s winning strategy: focus. My friend picked
a plan and stuck to it. Sometimes, he didn’t get Park Place or
Boardwalk, but he’d always grab some expensive spaces and pump them with
housing and hotels. Mike would only own a few properties but one night’s
rent would cost you hundreds. He had a <em>few</em> Hilton’s when I had <em>a lot</em>
of <del>Embassy Suites ~~ ~~Holiday Inns ~~ ~~Super 8s</del> extra couches. His
few beat my many every time. Why? Because he focused his resources on
one thing.</p>
<p>That’s the lesson that our company,
<a href="http://reflect7.com" title="reflect7.com">Reflect7</a>, is trying to learn.
From JP’s <em><a href="http://loudjet.com/a/a-crappy-vision-is-better-then-lack-of-vision" title="Techneur: A Crappy Vision is Better Than Lack of Vision">A Crappy Vision is Better Than Lack of
Vision</a></em>, you
can see that we’re spread pretty thin. Just like my monopoly game, we’ve
scattered our resources over several projects. When we step back in
review, we see that some of these projects pay the bills, some build our
local brand, and some are shots in the dark. However, all of them are
not something we want to be defined as. We don’t want to be a “Trucking
Software Company”. We don’t want to be “A Mobile Software Consulting
Company.” We’re like teenagers graduating from high school, we don’t
know what we want to be. Right now, we’re just hitting the first two
years of prereqs with hopes of making third year’s tuition.</p>
<p>So what I’ve learned is that purpose takes time and experience. That you
shouldn’t consult away your resources because you won’t have any product
equity to show for it. You probably won’t have the passion either. I’ve
learned that a person who spends many years on one trade will have a
better product than a person who has spent one year on many trades. That
when we find our purpose, we’ll drop everything. I’ve learned that focus
wins the game of Monopoly and the game of business.</p>
