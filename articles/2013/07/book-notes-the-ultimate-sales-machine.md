I had always considered myself decent at sales. Nothing spectacular, but knew enough to close some deals.

I picked up Chet Holmes's book [The Ultimate Sales Machine][] and boy was I in for a surprise.


Introduction
------------

He starts the book with an anecdote about a carpet cleaning company that wants to increase their sales. He gives them one tactic. Instead of using product data in the sales process, use market data. i.e. cleaning your carpets has real health benefits. The carpet company was then able to sign up customers to have their carpets cleaned biannually, almost like a doctor's checkup.

Chet goes on to make a case that by reading this book, you'll need to work and apply the principles one hour a week. That it's important to work harder and not smarter and that "pigheaded discipline and determination" are the keys.


Time Management Secrets of Billionaires
---------------------------------------

Time management is an area that I've struggled with. So, I found this chapter to be extremely valuable. Chet states that a person must do the following six things:

1. Touch it once. e.g. If you open an email, do something with it. Either respond or delete it. Essentially, anything that you touch must be taken care of.
2. Make a daily list of the six most important tasks to accomplish. He states that you shouldn't have more than six.
3. Plan how long each task will take.
4. Assign time slots for each task.
5. Focus on the difficult projects first.
6. Ask yourself, "Will it hurt me to throw this away?"
