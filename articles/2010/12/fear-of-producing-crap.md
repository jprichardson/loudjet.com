Fear of Producing Crap
======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldcke4yacv1qzbc4f.jpg)

If you read any writings by any “life coaches” or any prominent
entrepreneurs, you’ve undoubtedly read the word “fear” thrown around
over and over again. The phrase “fear of failure” is a bit trite. I’ve
never felt that I’ve had a fear of failure. I’ve always felt that I’ve
never been afraid of failure, or even afraid of anything.

I woke up after a rough night of the Husker’s losing the Big-12
Championship. I remembered that I made a bunch of Facebook status
updates that I probably shouldn’t have. How embarrassing. I didn’t
really care that much though. The way I see it, people will accept the
good with the bad. 

I then realized that I do have a fear. I have a fear of producing crap.
I’m particularly referring to blogging, but this also [applies to our
software](http://reflect7.com/apps). I worry that some people won’t like
my writings. They’ll find them uninteresting. This may be true though,
but why should I care? Doesn’t it make sense to keep pushing myself to
write more and more? Eventually I should get better right?

What if Kanye West had a fear of producing crap? If he did, he wouldn’t
make any music then. Forgive the Kanye comparison; as I don’t have cool
Kanye sunglasses nor did I ever get invited to the MTV
awards. [Gayfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishsticks_(South_Park))
aside, to be successful, I can’t have that fear. It’s necessary to keep
working day-in and day-out.
