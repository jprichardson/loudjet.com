<h1>The Finest Way To Succeed</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l142payIgd1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping
others to succeed.” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill">Napoleon
Hill</a></p>
<p>Recently, my business partner <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Brian</a> had
dinner with a business associate (we’ll call him Joe) that we met in a
local entrepreneurship networking group. Joe told us that a local
company needed a mobile app to compliment their web app. Brian
enthusiastically agreed for <a href="http://reflect7.com">Reflect7</a> to meet with
this company to assess their needs. Then Joe dropped the bomb. Joe
wanted a recurring ‘fee’ for the work that we would do for this company.
This isn’t the first time someone wanted to charge us a finder’s fee.
But, this shit needs to end now.</p>
<p>I know, I know… some of you think that finder’s fees are the norm in our
industry. I don’t give a fuck. If you are one of those who asks for
finder’s fees, you’re a dick plain and simple. It’s not like you’re
helping to setup a corporate acquisition. No, you are introducing one
business associate or friend to another. That’s being a social human
being. When you’re asking for a finder’s fee, you’re sacrificing the
long term for a short term gain. If Joe had setup a meeting with this
company and a successful agreement went through between us and the
company, I would have held Joe in high regard. I would have considered
Joe if I came across a friend or associate that may have interest in
Joe’s services. Now, I just consider Joe to be another leach in the
industry. The way I see it, you should always be willing to help others
achieve success, doing this brings you success. Joe is permanently
blacklisted in my brain for any referrals or references.</p>
<p>The person that exemplifies my point the most is <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/entrepreneurial-heroes">Gary
Vaynerchuk</a>.
Gary helps, gives, and cares. Gary will often spend an hour a day on
<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">Ustream</a> just answering questions. Gary wants
you to be successful. He even attributes part of the success of his book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061914177?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techneur-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0061914177">Crush
It</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=techneur-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0061914177" alt="">
to his fans. He claims that many of his fans bought the book as way of
thanking him for his help. I can personally attest to this.</p>
<p>The next time you learn a new tool or technique, share it <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/451-whats-your-cookbook">like Chefs
do</a>! The next
time you offer to introduce two separate parties together, forgo the
finder’s fee. Who knows, one of them may know someone who could benefit
from your products or services.</p>
<p>The finest way to succeed is to help others succeed.</p>
<p>What do you think of finder’s fees? Do you think I’m crazy for calling
them BS?</p>
