A Real MVP Tale
===============

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhdzfwGVRA1qzbc4f.jpg)

Let’s recap: a MVP is the **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct that you
need before you start generating revenue.

[Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/) is a Twitter app that want’s to make
scheduling tweets simple. This feature is included in a lot of Twitter
clients, but Buffer thinks that by focusing on this one feature alone,
it can do it better. 

The author wrote an article on how he [built Buffer from scratch and got
his first paying customer within seven
weeks](http://blog.bufferapp.com/post/3328167762/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it).
I love his methodology on idea validation.

First he created a landing page that sold the value proposition. The
landing page has a button that says “see plans and pricing.” When people
would click it, there would be a message that said “you caught us early,
please leave your email address…” See below:

People left their emails. But would they pay? He created a pricing page
and used the same strategy as described before. See below:

People would click a pricing plan and leave their emails. Buffer the
idea that people would pay for was validated. Genius. Checkout the
[post](http://blog.bufferapp.com/post/3328167762/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it)
and checkout [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/). [I have no affiliation
with Buffer or the author, they just deserve some Google link-juice for
sharing their awesome methodology.]

One thing he doesn’t address is how to get people to the site in the
first place. [I wrote about a technique
before](http://techneur.com/post/631320672/time-to-get-scrappy). The
idea is simple, signup for Google Adwords. They frequently send out
\$100 coupons for new advertisers to use. Purchase some keywords, and
deploy your Adwords campaign. You can even take advantage of Google
Forms for your email input.

When it’s all said in done, you should be able to validate an idea with
at most four hours of work. That’s four hours well spent.
