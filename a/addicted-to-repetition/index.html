<h1>Addicted to Repetition</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l22eb6V1fG1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My head hit the pillow at around 9:30 PM last night. It had been a rough
week. You see, every night I’ve been blogging until about 2:30 in the
morning. The other night (Thursday morning), I was up until 3:30 AM.
This wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t have to get up at 6:30 AM. I’ve had
a goal since <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/ipad-smart-monkey">April
13th</a> to blog
every weekday. Occasionally, <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Brian</a> helps
me out. As my head hit the pillow, I remembered that I had neglected my
blogging duties for the following day (today). I thought… “I’ll just
repost a post from
<a href="http://techneur.wordpress.com">techneur.wordpress.com</a> or
<a href="http://blog.reflect7.com">blog.reflect7.com</a>” as those posts aren’t on
this blog and I would like to eliminate those blogs altogether since
they are unmaintained. My eyes quickly drifted to sleep. When I awoke
this morning I felt great; then I remembered “shit I didn’t blog, OK
just go find a post from those older blogs.” That felt like an easy way
out. Those posts should be saved for a Saturday or Sunday. I think that
if I posted them on a weekday I would be shortchanging my readers and
most importantly
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/the-best-exercise-any-entrepreneur-can-do">myself</a>.</p>
<p>I bet any seasoned blogger will tell you that to create a blog post
worth reading, it’s a lot of work. To do it everyday is near insanity.
It takes me on average at least two hours to create a blog post. Some
days more, some days less. I knock
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/best-customer-word">some</a> of
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/its-all-our-fault-why-building-a-business-on-the">them</a>
out of the park. Most of them receive very little attention. But two
hours a day! Two hours a day on top of my day job, on top of the hour a
day I spend exercising, on top of the time I spend on
<a href="http://reflect7.com">Reflect7</a>, on top of the time I spend with <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/family-number-one">my
fiance and son</a>.
It’s no surprise that I don’t make it to bed before 1 AM.</p>
<p>Ahh, but I know a secret to accomplishing goals. I learned this from
<a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/07/26/applying-jerry-seinfelds-chain-concept-to-personal-finance/">The Simple Dollar
blog</a>.
The idea came from Jerry Seinfeld the actor of my all-time favorite
sitcom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>. </p>
<p>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page
and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red
magic marker.\
\
 He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big
red X over that day. “After a few days you’ll have a chain. Just keep at
it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that
chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only
job next is to not break the chain.”\
\
 “Don’t break the chain.” He said again for emphasis.</p>
<p>It really works. It helped me run a half-marathon and now I just run
every weekday for health. Admittedly, I don’t use it for blogging. I
believe that’s because I have the mindset “if you say you’re going to do
it every weekday, you are going to do it every weekday.” It works. But
to get started, I believe the calendar method is great way to introduce
a positive habit in your life. I would love to build a web app that
would do this, but<del>I don’t have the time</del> erm, <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/dont-have-the-time">it’s not a
priority</a>. Take
the <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/idea-sucks">idea</a>, I’ll be your
first customer.</p>
<p>Am I addicted to repetition or am I addicted to accomplishing goals? Who
knows, but it feels great either way.</p>
<p>What techniques do you use to accomplish your goals?</p>
