Things that Stimulate Your Mind
===============================

In the spring and summer, I don’t listen to the radio in my car; this is
because I hate listening to ads. They steal my thoughts, so my car rides
consist of plain silence. However, when football season starts, I turn
the AM sports’ stations on. My mind then consumes all football related
information. I like it. But I don’t love it, because I still have to
deal with ads. I’ve noticed within the last month that I haven’t blogged
as much. Before, I was blogging every weekday. It was tough at times,
but it felt like an accomplishment. Maybe it’s because most of my
time concocting blogging posts was developed while driving?

A lot of my friends and family watch TV. At social gatherings a
conversation always comes up about various TV shows… Glee, How I Met
Your Mother, Southpark, etc. Then when asked about my TV preferences, I
always respond that I don’t watch TV unless it’s football. I don’t watch
TV because it’s mindless. I rarely walk away from a TV show that has in
some profound way encouraged me to challenge my thoughts or opinions. TV
is a waste of time, plain and simple. Ahhh, but some might consider me a
hypocrite. Because I do like movies. I like movies for two reasons:

1.  There is a beginning and an end. Usually, movies last anywhere from
    90 to 120 minutes. TV shows try to hook you for the entire season.
    In the past, when I would watch a few episodes of a series or some
    show, I’d feel the need to go back and watch all of the previous
    ones and tune in to upcoming shows. When a movie is over, I can
    resume what I was doing without planning for the next week to watch
    it again.
2.  There are a lot of movies that make me ‘think.’ They challenge my
    beliefs and encourage me to not accept the status quo. V for
    Vendetta and Inception are great examples of this.

When you have free time, I would encourage you to ask yourself if the
activity that you’re about to do (I’m not referring to physical
activity) will stimulate your mind? Or is it a mindless waste of time?

Two favorite sites of mine that stimulate my mind and make me think:
[mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/) and [Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com).
