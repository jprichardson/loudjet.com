<h1>You Can&#39;t Fake Passion</h1>
<p><a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/" title="You Can&#39;t Fake Passion"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5kuvpSUOu1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This post started out as a response to JP’s blog post <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/leveraging-social-capital-eight-circle-of-hell" title="Leveraging Social Capital and the 8th Circle of Hell">Leveraging Social
Capital and the 8th Circle of
Hell</a>
and took on a life of it’s own…</p>
<p><strong>My Multi-level Marketing Experience</strong></p>
<p>I signed up for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Global" title="Wiki: Quixtar">Quixtar</a>as a
freshman in college ready to own my first BMW by age 21 and retire at
age 30. I found out that “Start-Up Kit” really meant “\$100 lesson in
how not to run a business.” As JP pointed out, the problem with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing" title="Wiki Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)">Multi-level
Marketing</a>
(MLM) Companies is that they try to leverage your relationships as a
revenue stream in an insincere way.\
\
During my first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Global" title="Wiki Quixtar">Quixtar</a>
meeting, the associate gave us a vision: “Imagine driving up to the bank
in your BMW, unshaven. You roll down the window to deposit a check for
\$2000. When the cashier sees the amount, she looks up and you smile -
all in a days work baby.” (He really said this). Then he bought
everybody lunch and asked us to sign on the dotted line.\
\
I signed because I was young and naive. After a few training sessions, I
was out. I didn’t feel right asking my friends to use products that (1)
I had no passion towards and (2) weren’t relevant to them. Hell, the
products weren’t even relevant to me so how was I supposed to sell them
to other people? And therein lies the problem with MLM.  A small few can
fake the passion and sell millions. The rest of us like to stay true to
ourselves and friends. We don’t want to monetize our friendships.</p>
<p><strong>MLM Bots</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://loudjet.com/a/leveraging-social-capital-eight-circle-of-hell" title="Leveraging Social Capital and the 8th Circle of Hell">Like
JP</a>,
I’ve been approached by several MLM people. Usually, it’s awkward and
forced. I’ve outlined the three main types of MLM Bots below:<strong>\
</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Newb Bot*</em></strong>:<em>*</em> The average MLM Newb Bot is new to business and
green around the ears. They strike up uncanny conversations in the
work-out section of Walmart. They ask if you like to work out frequently
and what you do to get good results (this happened to me). Really, it’s
all bullshit. They’re not actually interested in helping you or heeding
your advice, they just needed a convo starter to push their product. If
they’re feeling lucky, a drone might work up the guts to pitch you right
there. Usually they’ll say, “You seem like the type that knows what
you’re talking about. Ever thought about owning your own business?” If
their voice doesn’t crack, they count it as a victory.</p>
<p><em>Strength:</em>Has a lot of Newb friends that are prime for signing up.</p>
<p><em>Weakness</em>: Newb Bots are easily shot down with rational arguments and
don’t possess the confidence for rebuttal or stomach for confrontation.</p>
<p><em>Longevity</em>: Newb Bots will drop out of the MLM business in 2-4 months
because they could only sign other Newb Bots for their downline (people
signed up underneath them). They eventually realize that they’re all
Newbs and should go back to college. Meanwhile, the MLM company makes a
shitload off of their initial investment kits. Ka-ching!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Alpha Bot:</em></strong> This MLM Bot is particularly adept at preying on
the weak. They are usually the alpha dogs of the pack and have gotten
where they are by being pushy. You send an Alpha Bot into a room full of
people and they’ll come out with five party bookings. The problem is
that no one will show up because they didn’t like how pushy they were
and/or didn’t actually sell the host on the product. The mark of an
Alpha Bot is someone who assumes the sale before they’ve found out your
needs. They will say, “Nice to meet you, I sell this and this, so when
do you want to book the party?”</p>
<p><em>Strength:</em>Lack of empathy. By only thinking of themselves, the Alpha
Bot is able to push past other peoples’ negative emotional cues<em>.</em> They
will persist until the sale is made, no matter how tactless.<em>\
</em></p>
<p><em>Weakness</em>: Unlike Newb Bots, the Alpha Bot will continually rebut an
argument. They don’t mind confrontation because they constantly use it
to their advantage. There’s no nice way to say “No thanks” to an Alpha
Bot. Their weakness lies in their ability to view everything as a
possible alpha-status attack. To defeat them, simply say, “I don’t want
to book a party because I don’t like you and/or don’t want to use your
products.” They will rebut with a “why” which is when you say,”I don’t
care to discuss it.” Boom! You’ve just shut down all of their
premeditated counters. They’ll huff and puff their feathers to make a
big show. They’d never let others see the tail between their legs
because it’s too much of an ego-bruising.</p>
<p><em>Longevity</em>: The Alpha Bot will last years and years in the industry.
They will cruise to the top by running over non-confrontational people.
Just remember, if they try to drive over you, they’ll be cruisin’ for a
bruisin’, and you’re Captain Bruisin’.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Value Bot:</em></strong> The Value bot is a socially savvy bot that caters
to your needs and isn’t pushy about it. They ad extra value to their
product by offering great service and extra knowledge. A Value Bot is
worried about what you need, no matter the relevance to their product
line. They want to talk to you because they like helping people. The
Value Bot will stay in your life for a long time because they forge real
relationships. When you meet one, you will know because they will ask
you questions about what you do and offer real advice to help you reach
your goals. You’ll learn what a Value Bot does because they’re
passionate rather than pushy.</p>
<p><em>Strength:</em>Empathy and positive regard for others. The Value Bot puts
their knowledge to work for you.</p>
<p><em>Weakness:</em> Too much time helping others. A Value Bot’s only weakness is
that they put your needs first. This can ultimately hurt them because
they are helping instead of selling. If a Value Bot can strike a
balance, they will be very successful. If you notice a struggling Value
Bot, help them find clients.</p>
<p>You can defeat a Value Bot by saying… Wait, uh, you cannot defeat a
Value Bot because you are never fighting a Value Bot. You are always on
the same side.</p>
<p>Longevity: Value Bots usually rise to the top. They’ll be in it for life
because they are passionate about what they do.</p>
<p><strong>Product Focus vs. Money Focus</strong></p>
<p>That being said, there are a lot of MLM companies that have a good
reputation. As JP mentioned, <a href="http://pureromance.com/" title="pureromance.com">Pure
Romance</a>, <a href="http://www.marykay.com/" title="marykay.com">Mary
Kay</a>, and <a href="http://www.pamperedchef.com/index.jsp?localeString=en_us" title="pamperedchef.com">Pampered
Chef</a>
are all household names of quality.
(Sc)<a href="http://www.amway.com/EN" title="amway.com">amway</a> is not. With the
former, products sales drive revenue. Now that I’m viewing their
website, I see that Amway has came a long way since it’s Quixtar <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4375477/" title="MSNBC on Amway: The Pursuit of the Almighty Dollar">bad
PR</a>
days. They’ve rebranded Quixtar into Amway Global and have become more
product-focused.</p>
<p>It’s up to the individual companies to set the tone for their sales
reps. If a company (<a href="http://www.eiro.com/" title="eiro.com">EIRO</a>) puts a pile
of cash on their front page to entice potential recruits, then they’re
not focusing on their product. This is a money first mentality. A
mentality that their sales reps will probably adopt. I don’t want
money-driven Newb and Alpha Bots interrupting me while I’m pumping gas.
If someone interrupts me, they better have some real passion behind what
they’re saying. They better be a Value Bot.</p>
<p>If you look at the front page of Pure Romance, Mary Kay, and even Amway
(they’ve learned their lesson), you won’t see BMWs or fat stacks of
cash. If you look at <a href="http://www.eiro.com/" title="eiro.com">EIRO</a>’s front
page, that’s practically all you see. It’s cool, they’ll learn their
lesson or die out just like the rest of them.</p>
<p>With that being said, an individual sales rep can still trump bad
company policy. If an <a href="http://www.eiro.com/" title="eiro.com">EIRO</a> rep is
passionate and truly believes in their energy drinks, then I am much
more likely to give them a try. If I am already a consumer of Redbull
and EIRO can offer a better value proposition, then I’m sold.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It’s all about passion and product relevance. You can bet your tasty can
of EIRO that if one of my friends likes Husker Football and has an
iPhone that I’m going to tell them about our <a href="http://reflect7.com/" title="reflect7.com">Reflect7 Football
Apps</a>. For two reasons: (1) the
product is relevant to them and (2) I’m passionate about it. However,
companies that thrive off of pyramidal kit sales can lick my sweaty
Redbulls.</p>
