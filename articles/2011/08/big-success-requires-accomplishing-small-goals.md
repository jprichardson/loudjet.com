Big Success Requires Accomplishing Small Goals
==============================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqqv0mmcRi1qzbc4f.jpg)

I often fall victim to this. I’m very ambitious; typically I have many
projects and goals running concurrently. It’s important to remember that
you must break down your goals into smaller goals.

-   Want to run a marathon? Start by running 1 mile, and then 2 miles,
    etc.
-   Want to make a 1 million dollars? Learn how to make 1000 dollars
    first.
-   Want to [write a
    book](http://techneur.com/post/2958461062/i-will-write-an-ebook)?
    Use [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) to
    write one paragraph a day.
-   Want to write an autobiography? Write one blog post every day.

It sounds so easy, but yet it’s tough to do this. Lately, I’ve been
using the todo iPhone app [Do It (Tomorrow)](http://tomorrow.do/) to
break up my goals into actionable tasks each day. So far, it’s worked
out great.

How do you accomplish your big goals? Do you use any specific tools?
