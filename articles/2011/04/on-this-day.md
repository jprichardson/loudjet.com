On This Day...
==============

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj6omiyL8K1qzbc4f.jpg)

… 28 years ago, it was a snowing evening, I was brought into this world.
By most of my peers, friends, and family, I’m considered a success. I
have a stable job, a healthy son, and loving fiance. Do I consider
myself a success? Not at all. Why? Because I won’t allow myself to
settle. I have enough. It’s not that I necessarily want more, it’s just
that I truly feel that I’m called to do something great. I feel like I
am not like anyone else that I know. I feel different. I feel special;
yes, in that cliche bullshit sense. Do you feel this way?

Don’t ever settle.

So, a toast to myself of much success within the next 10 years.
