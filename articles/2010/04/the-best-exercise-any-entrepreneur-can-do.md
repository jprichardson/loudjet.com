The Best Exercise Any Entrepreneur Can Do
=========================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0xz2hSLqP1qzbc4f.jpg)

…is to blog.

Here is why entrepreneurs should blog:

​1) **Crystalize Thoughts** - Blogging forces you to think about your
ideas. When you write down your ideas you began to think about them.
Reflect up on them. To quote Harry Beckwith: “Writing helps you to
crystallize your thoughts.”

​2) **Feedback on Ideas** - Blogging puts your ideas on an open public
forum for criticism. Often times you come up with what you think is a
great idea. If you blog about that idea and then solicit feedback, you
may be surprised on what you receive. In fact, your hot idea may turn
out to be crap.

​3) **Forces Learning** - Blogging helps you to learn. Often times you
won’t write about what you know, you may write about what you don’t know
about. Thus forcing you to research.

​4) **Improves Communication** - Blogging helps you to be a better
communicator. You are forced to explain your thoughts and ideas in a way
that your intended audience can understand. We all know that great
communication skills will never hurt any entrepreneur.

​5) **Create More Content** - Blogging is an investment in your
business. Each time you write an article about your ideas or thoughts,
you are creating more content. More entry points for people to learn
more about you and your business. Exposure is good.

​6) **Build Credibility** - Blogging allows you to share your knowledge.
Sharing your knowledge will help to improve your credibility and build
your personal brand.

\
I consider blogging to be a necessary mental exercise. Much like
physical exercise is necessary for our bodies to be healthy, blogging is
necessary for our entrepreneurial minds to stay fresh, sharp, and
nimble.\
