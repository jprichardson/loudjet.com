<h1>Fight the Man by Building Self-Reliance</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg1y13ASiP1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I recently read an <del>blog post</del> essay by David of
<a href="http://raptitude.com">Raptitude.com</a> misappropriately titled: “<a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/how-to-make-trillions-of-dollars/">How to
Make Trillions of
Dollars</a>.”
The title isn’t encouraging us to make trillions of dollars, rather,
it’s describing the massive consumer driven economy that encourages
unhappiness so that we get stuck in a perpetual cycle of consumerism and
how self-reliance is the only way to fight it. It’s well worth the read.
It’s one of the best articles that I’ve read in a long time.</p>
<p>I’ll show my favorite parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the second world war, a few privileged Americans developed a
brilliant formula for building an unimaginably huge economy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Our economy] demands that we make consumption our way of life,
that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we
seek our spiritual satisfactions, our ego satisfactions, in
consumption. The measure of social status, of social acceptance, of
prestige, is now to be found in our consumptive patterns […] We need
things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced, and discarded at an
ever increasing pace. We need to have people eat, drink, dress,
ride, live, with ever more complicated and, therefore, constantly
more expensive consumption.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>~American retail analyst <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lebow">Victor
Lebow</a> <em>(hat tip to reader
Anna for this)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, the seeds of consumerism are placed. We see this behavior
everywhere. Fictional character Tyler Durden from the movie Fight Club
said it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so
we can buy shit we don’t need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David writes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the television as their primary tool, very-high-level marketers
have managed to create a nation of people who typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>work almost all the time</li>
<li>absorb several hours of advertising every night, in their own
homes</li>
<li>are tired
and <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2010/10/being-healthy-is-not-normal/">unhealthy</a> and
vaguely dissatisfied with their lives</li>
<li>respond to boredom, dissatisfaction, or anxiety only by buying and
consuming things</li>
<li>have disposable income but can’t find a more fulfilling line of
work without losing their health insurance</li>
<li>create health problems for themselves, which can be treated with
drugs they can “ask their doctor about”</li>
<li>own <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/i-dont-want-stuff-any-more-only-things/">far
more</a> items
than they use, and believe they don’t
have <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/a-day-in-the-future/">enough</a></li>
<li>are easily distracted from the unhealthy state of their lives and
their culture by breaking news and celebrity gossip</li>
<li>perpetually convince themselves it is not the right time to make
major lifestyle changes</li>
<li>happily buy stuff that breaks within a year, and which nobody
knows how to fix</li>
<li>have learned, through the media’s culture of blame-mongering, that
the key to solving public and private issues is to find the right
people to hate</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>…..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are being encouraged, from virtually every angle, to become or
remain unhealthy and unfulfilled, because then you will buy more. Not
to make you paranoid, but that’s the primary purpose of the glowing
rectangle in your living room — to encourage poor (but not
quite <em>failing</em>) health, general complacency, and an unconscious
reflex for parting with money.</p>
<p>I’m not even telling you to throw your TV out the window. But that’s
definitely a move with a very
high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_Investment">ROI</a>, if the
thought interests you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People watching TV; the epitome of a way that a person can waste time.
I’ve come to despise TV. The sound of it being on represents lost
opportunities.*</p>
<p>David writes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So don’t hate The Man, it will only weaken and distract you from what
you might accomplish if you don’t follow his cues. Hate has a
terrifically poor ROI, at least as far as quality of life goes. If
you’ve got some rage you feel needs “investing”, take up a racquet
sport. Direct your rage away from any people and animals, and when
your tantrum is over, turn your energy towards the cultivation of your
life skills.</p>
<p>I’m not referring to situationally-specific life skills like changing
tires, folding button-up shirts, or opening public washroom doors
without touching the handle, though they are certainly useful.</p>
<p>Here I’m talking about the real fundamentals of being an empowered,
self-directed human being.</p>
<p>Creativity. Curiosity. Resilience to distraction. Patience with
others.</p>
<p>And to make these all possible: <em>self-reliance</em> — an unswerving
willingness to take responsibility for your life, regardless of who
had a hand in making it the way it is.</p>
<p>Cultivate these qualities in yourself <em>and</em> others, and when this way
of life becomes more normal than getting one’s lifestyle cues from
discount-store flyers and CNN, the surefire trillionaire strategy
won’t work anymore. For anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-reliance. I believe this is one of the fundamental tenets of
entrepreneurship that motivates us to do what we do. <strong>SELF-RELIANCE</strong>. </p>
<p>David writes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not us against them, it’s us for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We aren’t fighting a battle. We are doing this for ourselves. Go read
the essay now.</p>
<p>*I should note that although I hate TV, I do enjoy sports and movies.
I’ll save that rationale for another post.</p>
