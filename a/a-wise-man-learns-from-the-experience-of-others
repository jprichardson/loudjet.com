<h1>A Wise Man Learns from the Experience of Others</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lauctic75p1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wise man learns from the experience of others; a fool by his own. -
Ancient proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just sold an old 52” rear-projection HDTV for \$200 cash. I sold it
the night before a home football game, so I had \$200 cash in my wallet.
On most home football games that I don’t have my son, my fiance and I go
downtown to tailgate. How much money do you think was in my wallet the
next day? Yes, you guessed it… \$0.</p>
<p>I refer to this as retarded spending. There is no reason any human being
needs to spend \$200 on a game day. Really. There isn’t. I don’t care if
you have millions. It’s absurd spending. The problem is that I get
really generous the more that I drink. That generosity usually leads to
rounds of shots. As you probably know, a shot can cost anywhere from \$3
to \$8. A few rounds for you and your friends can easily set you back
\$50 to \$75.</p>
<p>I’m not materialistic at all. I don’t want to spend money on nice
things. I’m on a path to
<a href="http://techneur.com/tagged/minimalism">minimalism</a>. But for some reason
I have no problem spending money on experiences. I don’t view that a
problem in and of itself. It’s just the amount that I need to be careful
of. This is particularly important if I want to be a successful
entrepreneur. It’s necessary to <a href="http://techneur.com/post/1012320994/so-you-want-to-become-rich">stockpile as much cash as
possible</a>.</p>
<p>So why the quote at the beginning? Because I <a href="http://www.andrewfashion.com/2009/12/04/young-stupid-how-i-lost-my-millions/">read the this
story</a>.
It’s about a guy who made \$2.5 million and then lost it all by stupid
purchases. Be wise and learn from his experience.</p>
