<h1>A Real MVP Tale</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhdzfwGVRA1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s recap: a MVP is the <strong>M</strong>inimum <strong>V</strong>iable <strong>P</strong>roduct that you
need before you start generating revenue.</p>
<p><a href="http://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a> is a Twitter app that want’s to make
scheduling tweets simple. This feature is included in a lot of Twitter
clients, but Buffer thinks that by focusing on this one feature alone,
it can do it better. </p>
<p>The author wrote an article on how he <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/post/3328167762/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it">built Buffer from scratch and got
his first paying customer within seven
weeks</a>.
I love his methodology on idea validation.</p>
<p>First he created a landing page that sold the value proposition. The
landing page has a button that says “see plans and pricing.” When people
would click it, there would be a message that said “you caught us early,
please leave your email address…” See below:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhdyirwsga1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>People left their emails. But would they pay? He created a pricing page
and used the same strategy as described before. See below:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhdynsuMzI1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>People would click a pricing plan and leave their emails. Buffer the
idea that people would pay for was validated. Genius. Checkout the
<a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/post/3328167762/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it">post</a>
and checkout <a href="http://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a>. [I have no affiliation
with Buffer or the author, they just deserve some Google link-juice for
sharing their awesome methodology.]</p>
<p>One thing he doesn’t address is how to get people to the site in the
first place. <a href="http://techneur.com/post/631320672/time-to-get-scrappy">I wrote about a technique
before</a>. The
idea is simple, signup for Google Adwords. They frequently send out
\$100 coupons for new advertisers to use. Purchase some keywords, and
deploy your Adwords campaign. You can even take advantage of Google
Forms for your email input.</p>
<p>When it’s all said in done, you should be able to validate an idea with
at most four hours of work. That’s four hours well spent.</p>
