Facebook Connects Us, And Disconnects Us
========================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5y8hb0LMP1qzbc4f.jpg)

500,000,000 users. That’s a lot of zeros sharing their drunken stupor
pics over the internet. More importantly, that’s a lot of people staying
connected. Social websites allow you to look-in on your friends. [To

on their happenings and whereabouts. Facebook has helped me organize and
attend events that I wouldn’t have known about. Facebook has also kept
me complacent about my social network…

**Trailer Parks**

Maybe I was rubbing elbows with Trailer folk over a bottle of moonshine,
or maybe a psychologist I respect mentioned this to me tonight: that
trailer parks have the highest level of connectedness when it comes to
neighborhoods. On one hand, there’s the physical location of being
literally right in the other persons front yard. On the other hand,
there’s the technological dislocation. I’m making an assumption here so
I could be making an ass out of myself. But assuming that Trailer park
attendees are poor (hence the trailer situation), I conclude that they
probably aren’t furnishing the latest Macbook Pro. They’re probably not
connected to the internet at all, which means that they’ll have to get
their social needs from, gasp, their neighbors!

**Back In The Day**

Many will say, “Brian, have you been staring at [The Double
Rainbow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI "Full On Double Rainbow")
too long?” Yes, I have (it’s almost a triple rainbow!!!). But I also
say, “look at your parents.” Back in the day, my parents only social
interaction was done physically (and via phone) with family, friends,
and neighbors. There weren’t any virtually represented friends and you
actually had to see, or talk to someone, to consider yourself involved.
Today’s Facebook friendships don’t require any effort.

Don’t get me wrong, Facebook is revolutionary as an efficient form of
communication (and stalking). But it makes it all the more easier to
cash out on our friendships. Just like texting, Facebook is a minimally
invasive way to interact. However, the less invasive, the less the
impact.

Think about it this way, when I’m talking with a friend in person, how
well can I gauge their emotion? Pretty damn good. When I’m talking on
the phone, how well can I gauge their emotion? Pretty good, but not as
well as in person. I don’t even want to get into the miscommunications
I’ve had while texting. Now consider Facebook. Most of the interaction
is done via the Wall. How much can I gauge a person’s woes by posting
something on their wall? Not much. How much affect am I really having
when I leave “That’s what she said” with a smiley face in response to my
friend’s status?

**Old Balls**

Call me old balls, I’m almost thirty, but I liked the good ‘ol days when
my parents chilled with the neighbors and talked about real shit. Where
the amount of Facebook friends or Twitter Followers didn’t define you
([Southpark: You have 0
friends](http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/267112)). I liked it
when you could actually feel the person you were talking to (that’s what
she said).

I’ll be the first to admit that when I had a hot chick as a Facebook
friend, I was much less likely to delete her. Even if her Facebook
status updates were self-involved and she made that fucking kissy face
in every photo. Acquaintances have become social commodities for value
when no one person should be used as a means to an end [[Kant’s

**I’m Not Your Fucking Friend\
**

If you’re feeling a little testy after reading this, here’s a letter you
can send to 3/4ths of your “friends” on Facebook.

> Dear Person I Have Spent More Time Stalking Than Interacting With,
>
> We are not friends. We are mutual acquaintances that know some awkward
> shit about one another. Although we might actually give a shit about
> each other at some point, we really don’t right now. And that’s okay.
> So don’t wish me Happy Birthday and I won’t congratulate you on your
> new haircut (don’t worry, frosted tips are still in). So let’s just
> nut up and admit that we’re really just in each others glorified
> Rolodex. No big deal.
>
> PS. I also like obscure music and limited-release films because I’m
> UnIQuE. My bio info is also [enter something witty here].

**Conclusion**

JP is right - [we are insecure about not
knowing](http://techneur.com/post/840820906/leverage-simplicity-and-the-desire-for-information).
Social networks give us a way to stay informed in a very convenient way.
Perhaps so convenient that we forget that with more connections, comes
more dilution. In the meanwhile, I’m going to take a hint from Trailer
Folk and focus on the relationships that matter - the ones on my front
lawn.
