<h1>Use a Weakness to Develop a Strength</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l567lhkAUc1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We all have weaknesses. We all have behaviors or personality traits that
we don’t like. I think that it’s possible to take some of these
behaviors, personality traits, or bad habits and do something positive
with them.</p>
<p>Are you’re introverted? You need to change that, but in the meantime use
the quiet time to focus and get work done. Are you a smoker? Engage in
conversation with other smokers, maybe you’ll make a business
connection. Do you waste a lot of time watching TV? Start a blog about
your favorite shows and analyze the characters and plots. Maybe you’ll
generate some side income. I realize that there are a lot of negative
personality traits and bad habits that it would be difficult to
capitalize upon all of them, but I think it’s worth a try.</p>
<p>So what’s mine? I believe that I have a small case of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_personality_disorder">OCPD</a>
not to be confused with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">OCD</a>.
In short, I can be a bit compulsive. Now, I have no professional
diagnosis of this, but I match the DSM’s diagnosis in most of the
categories. Oh well. So, how do I turn this into strengths?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m obsessive about being completely honest. I don’t consider white
lies acceptable, and if I felt that I may have blurted out something
that could be potentially misconstrued as not being true, I’ll make
a point to correct it. I’ve ingrained in myself the moral code of
integrity.</li>
<li>I’ve ran approximately 15 miles/week for the last two years.</li>
<li>I typically won’t allow myself to watch TV unless it’s a little
sports or I’m on the treadmill.</li>
<li>I write daily.</li>
<li>Once I’m into a project, I find it very easy to kick ass on it. This
is because I’ll obsess over it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I obsess over improving my relationships, health, and
professional career by working at it daily, but if I don’t do it daily,
I find it difficult, maybe even more difficult than the average person.</p>
<p>Look in the mirror and try to figure out if you can use your weaknesses
to develop strengths.</p>
<p>Do you think this is the case? Do you have any examples in your own life
to share? If so, please post.</p>
