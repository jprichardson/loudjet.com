Prison and Taking Things for Granted
====================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lah9u4K46O1qzbc4f.jpg)

This post is going to depart from my traditional posts on business,
entrepreneurship, technology, etc. I just read a post on a humor forum
called 99Chan. The post describes a guy’s two year prison experiment.
It’s very long, but if you have the time, it’s well worth the read.

Note that since it was posted on a humor forum, the forum automatically
substitues certain words to make postings sound funnier. With that being
said, the following lists the words and their actual meanings:

-   touch dicks - hang out
-   sister - girlfriend
-   homie - fag
-   pedophile - band

Go read
it: [](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=136858)[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic\_id=136858](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=136858) 

So why did I post this? Two reasons:

1.  I think as entrepreneurs it’s necessary to subject ourselves to the
    beliefs and experiences of others. Entrepreneurs should not be
    one-dimensional.
2.  The story itself may make you think about more about what you have
    and may bring a deeper sense of appreciation.

Hope you enjoy it.
