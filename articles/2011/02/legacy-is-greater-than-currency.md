Legacy is Greater than Currency
===============================

> - Gary Vaynerchuk

This is one of my favorite Gary Vaynerchuk quotes. The premise is
simple: if you focus on the long term or the “big picture” as Gary likes
to say and not settle on short-term gains, the currency will come.

Wath the video:

 [Shane Mac](http://shanemac.me/) recently wrote an [article on why he
uses Foursquare or Gowalla to checkin at
places](http://blog.shanemac.me/the-reason-i-check-in-isnt-what-you-think).

After watching Gary’s video and reading Shane’s post, it could be
thought that both points are only related by the word “legacy.” 

Gary is encouraging us to focus on our personal brand and making
decisions based upon the long-term. Despite that he says “… the currency
will come” he is not encouraging us to focus on our legacy for the sake
of currency. That’s just a side benefit. He is encouraging our focus on
the long-term because customers will notice, friends will notice, and
people will notice. He is encouraging it because it’s the [right thing
to do](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sm/the_meaning_of_right/). This will all
have a side-effect of improving our business. Our lives. Ourselves.

Shane is encouraging us to question our legacy. For the first time in
human history, we are presented with technology that allows us to write
[not in the literal sense] our history as Shane points out by using
check-in software.

Both Shane and Gary indirectly and directly encourage us to use
technology to build our legacy. We can use this technology to improve
ourselves, our business, and our legacy.
