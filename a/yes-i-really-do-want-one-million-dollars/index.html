<h1>Yes, I Really Do Want One Million Dollars</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lducpwx5gX1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>….actually more like <strong><em>five</em></strong> million dollars.</p>
<p>This is in response to this article: <a href="http://ryanwaggoner.com/2010/12/you-dont-really-want-a-million-dollars/">You Really Don’t Want a Million
Dollars</a></p>
<p>I <strong>don’t</strong> want five million dollars so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can buy a nice Ferrari, Masserati, etc.</li>
<li>I can buy a nice mansion with an indoor pool.</li>
<li>I can buy my fiancee 10 carat ring.</li>
<li>I can pay for my son to go to any ivy league school.</li>
</ol>
<p>No, no… that’s stuff that I don’t want. Don’t get me wrong, some of it
would be nice, but entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p>I <strong>do</strong> want five million dollars so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If my son or fiancee get a life-threatening illness, I can stop
working to spend time with them and know that they’ll still get the
best treatment that money can buy. In short, it acts as insurance.</li>
<li>I can influence positive change quicker and deliver more of an
impact. Money acts as leverage. With a lot money, I could
potentially improve more lives in the world today.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s about it. I want insurance and leverage. So, why <strong><em>five</em></strong>
million? At a conservative interest rate of 3% per year, I would net
150k. That’s enough for a family to live on for quite some time. If I
had to spend one million or two for health costs or charitable givings,
it still wouldn’t impact my standard of living too much.</p>
<p>Currently, I make enough money where I don’t have to worry too much.
That’s really all I need. I make a pittance compared to a software
engineer in California, but for Nebraska I make enough.</p>
<p>So for now, I’m focused on doing the best job that I can do each day and
before I can improve the lives of people all over world, I must start
with the people around me. I’ll end with some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can’t feed 100 people, just feed one. -Mother Teresa</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in
developing the capacity to enjoy less. - Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
