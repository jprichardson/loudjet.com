Start with a Vision
===================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldh9lg2jYz1qzbc4f.png)

Almost two years ago, I brought together [Corey &
Brian](http://reflect7.com/about-us) into a local bar. Our topic for
discussion was our not-yet-created startup and mobile software. I had
owned an iPhone for about six months; I knew that everyone would own a
GPS-enabled smartphone within the next five years. I’m pretty sure that
most people could’ve told you the same thing. But I digress, we weren’t
sure what we wanted to build. One suggestion that came to mind was
putting the schedule of the [Huskers](http://huskers.com) on an app. The
idea was to solve the problem of not having to carry around a little
schedule card in one’s wallet. Everyone agreed that it sounded like a
good project to get started with.

There was one major problem. There was no vision attached to our
startup. Yes, we came up with a mantra: “start small, build fast, dream
big” which is cute, but when the going gets tough, a mantra won’t keep
you going. We eventually cobbled together a
[vision](http://reflect7.com/vision) that resembles the idea that smart
phones will be the epicenter of our lives. Cue someone saying “no shit
sherlock.” Our vision doesn’t represent anything related to our product
offerings. That’s a problem.

I believe that a good vision must go beyond what problems your product
will solve. It must communicate values and belief. It must be very
visible so that you and your co-founders read it over and over again;
even better if your customers can read it. But it’s not enough to just
read it, a good vision must be livable - so that when you’re pulling an
all-nighter to hit your deadline, you can refer back to your vision to
remind yourself why it is you’re working so hard.

What are your thoughts on vision? What do you think of the importance of
vision? Do you think it’s necessary to start with a good vision?
