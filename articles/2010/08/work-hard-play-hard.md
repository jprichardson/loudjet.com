Work Hard, Play Hard
====================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7g9kaa0kQ1qzbc4f.jpg)

I’ve always admired Jack Welch for his success at GE. Jack started out
as an engineer and worked his way up to being the CEO. One of his
mantras was “Work Hard, Play Hard.” By reading about Jack’s tales, I’m
not quite sure he understood what balance is, but he understood that a
person can’t be just about work and that a person must partake in
activities outside of work.

Tomorrow, I’ll be in Copper Mountain, Colorado running the [Warrior
Dash](http://www.warriordash.com/index.php). I’m excited! Running has
helped to relieve my entrepreneurial stresses. I also look forward to
wearing the fuzzy warrior helmets and then having a few beers
afterwards!

I’ll be back on Monday.
