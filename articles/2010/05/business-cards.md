Viva La Business Cards
======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2jlo343dj1qzbc4f.jpg)

This last weekend, my [business partners and
I](http://reflect7.com/about-us)were at [Big Omaha](http://bigomaha.com)
(one of the best business networking experiences of my life). Before we
got to the Slowdown, we were eating dinner and discussing expectations
and our excitement for the conference. Corey made a comment on how he
doesn’t like our business cards; I then said that I think business cards
in general are a waste. You see, I’ve been on this kick for striving
towards [minimalism](http://techneur.com/post/594481128/admirable-simplicity) and
the [reduction of
stuff](http://techneur.com/post/567516819/detoxify-your-life)… I’ve
never kept a business card. I transcribe the information and then throw
them away. “I think we should just tell people to keep their business
cards. Let’s connect with them on Twitter, as Twitter is a more personal
and intimate way to connect than a piece of paper.” I said. Brian
expressed some hesitancy, as he feared that some would be offended. I
conceded that that may be an issue. Our general consensus was to just do
it anyway and gauge people’s reaction.

We arrived at the Slowdown. We started networking immediately. The
inevitable came. “Hey man, it was great to meet you… let me give you my
card.” Me: “Ya… ugghhh… umm.. OK.” I didn’t have the balls to do it. As
I kept ingesting the liquid courage, I was finally able to say to tell
people my new found revelation of business card wastefulness. “No dude,
keep your business card. I’ll end up throwing it away anyways. Let’s
connect on Twitter.” Them: “ummm… OK, sure I guess.” I got the sense
that most people were offended by that statement. I realized that my
delivery was insensitive. I figured that if I tuned it to a more
diplomatic approach then I might get a different reaction.

The next night at the Nomad as the inevitable statement came out “Let me
give you…” I then presented my grand metaphor on how business cards are
like the horse & buggy and Twitter was like the car, as if I was some
business networking pioneer. Some people saw my point of view, most
didn’t. Worse, people were still offended. I’m sure some thought I was
full of shit or even a bit
[arrogant](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/05/arrogant.html).
I bombed it bad. I was trying to transition our great conversations onto
an internet medium. It was tougher than I expected.

I reflected upon this. I couldn’t quite figure out why people didn’t
quite see my point of view. Ya, there was a bit of friction when you
have to open up your Twitter client and type in someone’s Twitter name
right in front of them when they could have easily handed you a card.
Coincidentally, Today I read the article [Sometimes Five Seconds Is All
It
Takes](http://www.littlethingsmatter.com/blog/2010/05/14/sometimes-five-seconds-is-all-it-takes/).
Todd Smith Quotes Mark Jeffries:

In this interview Mark said, “You have to make the other person feel
great about their communication with you.  Don’t put someone’s business
card in your pocket.  They are handing you a little life story.  If you
don’t take a moment to look at the card, acknowledge it and say
something about it, you are missing a huge opportunity to tilt the
scales in your favor.  This is one differentiator point, but it could be
all you need to get into positive territory.”

It hit me. It didn’t matter how I said it. I rejected people’s life
story.
