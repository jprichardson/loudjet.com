What Captain Jack Sparrow Can Teach Us About Entrepreneurship
=============================================================

I was blissfully enjoying [The Pirates of
the Caribbean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)
with my family and my ears perked up when Jack was having a conversation
with Elizabeth on the desserted island. Elizabeth said:

> …you’ll be positively the most fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.

to which Jack replied:

> Not just the Spanish Main, luv. The entire ocean. The entire world.
> Wherever we want to go, we’ll go. That’s what a ship is, you know.
> It’s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails, that’s what a
> ship needs but what a ship is… what the Black Pearl really is… 

I knew exactly what Jack was going to say.

> …what the Black Pearl really is… is freedom.

I look for inspiration in about every aspect of my life. I could
probably be inspired by watching a cactus grow. However, this is
different. To quote Harry Beckwith: “Fiction teaches us about people.”
Seriously, it does. How about when Huckelberry Finn convinced everyone
it was fun to paint the fence? He taught us a bit about motivation. What
did The Great Gatsby teach us? It taught us about money and superficial
relationships. But, I digress. I can save that for another blog post.

Regardless, Jack Sparrow shows us that successful people persevere. In
every successful person’s biography, there are always tails of
perseverance. ALWAYS. [Gurbaksh

[Trent Hamm](http://thesimpledollar.com), and [Tony
Hseih](http://techneur.com/post/671778103/delivering-happiness-review)
all have this trait in common. Don’t forget it. When shit has you down,
remember, that to be successful, you have to be able to persevere.
