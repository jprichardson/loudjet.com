<h1>What the Restaurant Industry Can Teach Us About Business: Customer Expectations</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqfrquH7C21qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A colleague of mine dropped by my office to share his wonderful dining
experience at the <a href="http://www.bonefishgrill.com/">Bonefish Grill
restaurant</a>. This colleague and I like to
banter about our dining experiences; we use to agree that the Bonefish
Grill was one of the best dining experiences. I should be clear, I’ve
never had a bad dining experience at the Bonefish Grill. It’s just been
inconsistent.</p>
<p>The first time that I went to the Bonefish Grill, I walked into to the
restaurant with my wife and I could smell the aroma of fresh seafood.
The entry area, where the bar resides, was dimly lit like that of a
college bar. It was packed with people like a college bar too, albeit
not in a manner liked you’d expect; it was comfortable. Conversation was
everywhere, not too loud, not too quiet. Perfect. The night was ripe for
an excellent date.</p>
<p>My wife and I were lucky enough to score some seats at the bar while we
waited for a table. The bar tender promptly took our order for drinks.
Two small TVs were in the bar area. Just enough to check the score of
the game, but not enough to distract a table from intimate conversation.
The bar tender brought over a shrimp appetizer, Bang Bang Shrip,
courtesy of the house. “We call this: making friends” he said. Very
rarely does a restaurant give away food to patrons without reason. They
set themselves up well. Even better, the shrimp was delicious.</p>
<p>Finally our pager buzzed and we were able to get a seat. The attentive
server took our order as if we were her only concern, almost like a
private butler. It was amazing. We topped the night off with a dessert.</p>
<p>I walked out of the Bonefish Grill feeling that I had one of the best
dining experiences ever. At least, the best in Nebraska.</p>
<p>The restaurant had just become my favorite restaurant. I was now their
evangelist. Almost like a Jesus spreading the gospel, but not about
eternal life, but the gospel of the freshest and most delicious seafood
the Midwest would ever see.</p>
<p>The second and third time that I went there. The experience was just
average. It wasn’t bad, just average. Slow staff. Messed up sides, etc.
I expect this sort of stuff to happen at Applebee’s, not my beloved
Bonefish.</p>
<p>The restaurant became just another restaurant to me.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, I’m reminded of when I use to work as a cook at
the local restaurant <a href="http://www.lazlosbreweryandgrill.com/">Lazlos</a> 12
years ago. When I was packing up an order, I put an extra serving of
french fries for a to-go order. The owner Jay Jarvis saw this. “What are
you doing?” he said. “I wanted to put a smile on their face.”
I enthusiastically replied. He then told me that I had put too much
fries in the order; I was just thinking that he was being a cheap owner.
He then went on to say that the next cook might not put in as much for
that same customer. The customer will feel let down. What matters is
“consistency”, he said. That was my first real lesson in consistency and
customer expectations.</p>
<p>So many restaurants struggle with this. Maybe they don’t train their
staff enough to think about providing a consistent experience?</p>
<p>I didn’t write this article to complain about
restaurant inconsistencies, but rather to get you to think about the
experience you’re delivering to your customers. How can you be more
consistent? What tools and processes can you implement to improve this?</p>
<p>But don’t forget about the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/a-paradox-of-expectations.html">paradox of
expectations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better than expected might be the level of quality that’s necessary to
succeed. Of course, once that becomes the standard, the expectation is
reset. - Seth Godin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seth also
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/01/raising-expectations-and-then-dashing-them.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you noticed how upbeat the ads for airlines and banks are?</p>
<p>Judging from the billboards and the newspaper ads, you might be led to
believe that Delta is actually a better airline, one that cares. Or
that your bank has flexible people eager to bend the rules to help you
succeed.</p>
<p>At one level, this is good advertising, because it tells a story that
resonates. We want Delta to be the airline it says it is, and so we
give them a try.</p>
<p>The problem is this: ads like this actually decrease user
satisfaction. If the ad leads to expect one thing and we don’t get it,
we’re more disappointed than if we had gone in with no real
expectations at all. Why this matters: if word of mouth is the real
advertising, then what you’ve done is use old-school ad techniques to
actually undercut any chance you have to generate new-school results.</p>
<p>So much better to invest that same money in delighting and embracing
the customers you already have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about this. Be consistent.</p>
