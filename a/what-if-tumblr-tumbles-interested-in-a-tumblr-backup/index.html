<h1>What if Tumblr Tumbles? Interested in a Tumblr Backup Service?</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgeqv7rX001qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Please pardon the pun. But seriously, what if Tumblr fails? If you
didn’t know, this blog is hosted on Tumblr. To all of you Tumblrs out
there: what would you do if you if you woke up one morning and went to
visit your blog and it was gone either due to a Tumblr failure or
because Tumblr the company decided to close down? Would you care?</p>
<p>I know that I would care. I’ve poured a lot of work into this blog over
the last year. Tumblr’s server problems scare me. Their apparent lack of
a monetization scheme bothers me.</p>
<p>I’ve whimsically kicked around the idea of building a Tumblr backup
service. I wouldn’t put much stock into it, unless I had <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/customer-validation.html">customer
validation</a>. With
that being said…</p>
<p>Imagine there was a service where you could login and just input your
Tumblr url. The service would then run a backup process daily saving
your blog post, images, tags, and the blog post URL.</p>
<p>Is this something that you would pay for if you knew that you had the
piece of mind that your blog content was safely stored in the cloud and
that you could retrieve your data anytime? Would you pay \$5/month?
\$8/month? \$12/year? Would you still pay even though <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/286303145/tumblr-backup-mac-beta">Tumblr provides a
backup
tool</a>? </p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Please let me know.</p>
