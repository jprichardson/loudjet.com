Inspiration Is Perishable
=========================

“Inspiration is perishable” - [Jason
Fried](http://twitter.com/jasonfried)

This is one quote that has resonated with me well after [Big
Omaha](http://blog.reflect7.com/2009/05/16/big-omaha-recap/) 2009.
Inspiration is indeed perishable. I think this is something that affects
all of us. I’m sure you’ve had an ‘aha’ moment when you think of a great
idea - then you think: if only you had the time. But wait, you remember
that in a few weeks your schedule will clear up. Then you can act upon
your great idea! Weeks pass by. You didn’t act.

This is all too common. Personally, this happens to me all of the time.
I own about 30 unused domains that represent ideas for web apps. “Only
if I had more time.” The reality is, you will never have more time. Life
throws so much at us: kids, spouses, divorces, deaths, sickness, day
jobs, etc. You have to make more time.

You can start by decommitting. Do you really need to come home after
work and watch Lost for an hour? Do you really need to go out on Friday
night with your buddies and be hungover all day Saturday? Must you go to
that basketball game? Do you need to spend an hour on Facebook?

The choice is yours. If those things make you happy, then do them. But,
don’t be mad at yourself later in life because you didn’t act. The time
is now. Act today.

What techniques do you use so that you can act upon your great ideas
right away?
