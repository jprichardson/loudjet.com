<p>Bloggers Note: this started as a response to JP’s blog post <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/less-consumption-more-production" title="JP&#39;s Less Consumption, More Production Blog Post">Less
Consumption, More
Production</a>
and ended up having a life of it’s own…</p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away when reading news and blogs.  I’ve been
guilty of justifying long blog strolls as production because I thought I
was gaining some sort of knowledge base. After reading JP’s Less
Consumption, More Production, I tried to remember how much of this tech
news was actionable. That is, does knowing this new information convert
into an action that will improve my business? The answer was very
little.</p>
<p>\
I get giddy when I see new technology. That’s exciting for me as a tech
geek. But in the same vein, Justin Beiber’s new wardrobe is exciting for
any teenage girl. She’ll have that piece of information to bond with her
friends just as I would connect with other tech geeks about
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/196017994/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr?pos=2&amp;ref=spotlight" title="KickStarter: Diaspora">Diaspora</a>.
That common bond is great, but the justification behind attaining it can
lead to a slippery slope where one puts “talking” over “walking.” In my
job, I need to do a lot more walking.\
\
Not every site has been detrimental. For me, the business development
and self-improvement bloggers have been very influential. I hopped on
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" title="Seth Goden&#39;s Blog">Seth Goden’s blog</a>
this last week and back-read for nearly two hours. I just put some of
that knowledge into action yesterday. However, not much has been gained
from the tech news giants.</p>
<p>But wonder if I miss out on some crucial news that might effect my
technology business? Wonder if I miss out on some great tool? At least,
that is what I used to think. My answer now: I probably won’t. Here’s
why. I discover new tools and news based on my need rather than
pretending to keep inventory of every article. If I have an itch, I’ll
google it. I don’t need to know everything about every business because
99.99% of that information is not actionable. That is flat out
inefficient. The same goes for tracking logistics. There’s no point in
looking at analytics unless you can discern a clear action to take from
them.</p>
<p>I’ll still browse the headlines and dive into a few articles that are
relevant and/or interesting. But from now on, I’m putting an “action
filter” over my consumption.</p>
