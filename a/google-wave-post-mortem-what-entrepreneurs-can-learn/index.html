<h1>Google Wave Post Mortem - What Entrepreneurs Can Learn</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6ovff5zAY1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You’ve undoubtedly heard by now that Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">killed Google
Wave</a>.
As there is a lot of discussion on it on various sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/08/04/2129201/Google-Kills-Wave-Development">Slashdot: Google Kills Wave
Development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/08/05/1337254/Why-Wave-Failed">Slashdot: Why Wave
Failed</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cxh4x/google_kills_wave/">Reddit: Google Kills
Wave</a></li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1575892">HN: Google Kills Wave</a></li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1576207">HN: Save Google Wave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature list was amazing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realtime collaboration.</li>
<li>Realtime language translation.</li>
<li>Context aware spellchecking. </li>
<li>Drag &amp; drop file sharing.</li>
<li>Instant replay of the chronological changes.</li>
<li>Open sourced protocol so that anyone could run a Wave server.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The goal was audacious. They wanted to replace email. Their tagline was
“Imagine what email would look like if it were invented today.” Very
inspirational.</p>
<p>Despite never really using it much, I’m disappointed. I watched
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ">Google I/O
video</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itc4253kjhw">abridged</a>)
about a year ago and thought it was pretty damn cool. I remember when I
first got an invite. I was ecstatic! I opened it up and played around
with it for about 10 mins. What now? I thought.</p>
<p>Someone on Reddit commented that they thought Google Wave was like the
having a telephone but not having anyone to call. Why didn’t Google Wave
succeed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it because none of your friends or family were on it?</li>
<li>Was it because it wasn’t backwards compatible with email?</li>
<li>Was it because the Google Wave client (googlewave.com) was buggy?</li>
<li>Was it because Google didn’t promote it enough? Maybe they could
have integrated it with Gmail?</li>
<li>Was it ahead of its time?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we as entrepreneurs can glean a few lessons from the demise of
Wave.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flashy technology rarely means shit. Don’t get caught up into
building something just because it’s cool or looks awesome or has
super whizbang gadgets and gizmos.</li>
<li>Solving problems matters. Do people really have a communication
problem on the internet that IM/Email/Forums/Wiki can’t solve?
Before Stackoverflow was built, the
creators <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">realized</a> that existing
web Q&amp;A solutions suck. Email or IM don’t really suck for their
intended use. </li>
<li>If your product depends upon a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network
effect</a> to be
successful, make sure everyone and their dog can use it right away.
Yes, I know… Google had an invite system for Gmail. You see, Gmail
could still be used to email users on other email systems. Google
Wave was the only Wave system. Google shouldn’t have used invites
only.</li>
<li>Marketing matters. If no one knows about your product, no one will
come to use it. You have to put it in people’s faces. Google could
have leveraged Gmail to do this.</li>
</ol>
<p>All is not lost though. Fortunately a lot of the code is open sourced.
I’m sure it’ll make it into other products. Maybe someone else will come
out with a Wave implementation. Until then, I’ll keep using trusty old
email.</p>
