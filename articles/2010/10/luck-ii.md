Luck II
=======

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lacgnkxrq41qzbc4f.jpg)

I’ve wrote about [Luck](http://techneur.com/post/948686582/luck) before,
but I’m not sure I made my point as eloquently as I would have liked.
Recently, I was having a discussion on Hacker News about the value of
ideas. I made the following comment:

> That’s exactly right. Ideas aren’t worth much. I like Siver’s article
> on ideas as multipliers. Execution and the ‘business side of things’
> as you stated are what matters. If Zuckerberg didn’t execute like he
> did with Facebook, Facebook would’ve still have been a cute little toy
> project at Harvard. The idea of Facebook itself is pretty simplistic.

To which some individual called Zuckerberg lucky. He wrote:

> He was also lucky, in the right place and time, and savvy enough to
> exploit his luck. Plus, the value of Facebook (and other sites
> mentioned) is the community and mindshare. You can’t just buy a
> Facebook clone and expect overnight success.

Fortunately, some other commenter came in and delivered my feelings on
luck. Written better than I could have done myself:

> This attitude bugs me a lot. There is probably a path for every single
> person in this country to make a million dollars in the next year if
> they were just “savvy enough” to take advantage of it. It seems
> everyone wants to diminish Zuck’s success by ascribing luck to it, but
> let me tell you something. Zuck executed the shit out of Facebook. Did
> the community and mindshare just come out of thin air?
>
> There’s no good reason to believe that Zuckerberg is lucky at all.
> Saying he was in the right place at the right time has this tacit
> assumption that if he were somewhere else at the wrong time he would
> have tried the same thing and fell flat on his face.
>
> It seems because Facebook is an outlier, people feel safe talking
> about the luck factor, but that’s meaningless because we all exist
> with individual circumstances, and by that measure everything every

I love the part on safety. “People feel safe talking about the luck
factor.” I think it’s an excuse for people. It’s much easier to comment
or commend someone for being lucky than for actually busting their ass
off. 

What are your thoughts on luck?
