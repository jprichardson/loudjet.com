<h1>Eric Schmidt and the Google Triumvirate</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfcnp3cej41qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I learned that Google was not only run by its CEO Eric
Schmidt, but also by its founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page… as a
triumvirate! It’s impressive that they’ve been so successful so far with
such leadership. I attribute it to their
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/start-with-a-vision">vision</a>.
However, it’s of little surprise to me that Eric Schmidt is stepping
down.</p>
<p>According to
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/20/google-page-schmidt/">Techcrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the last 10 years, we have all been equally involved in making
decisions. This triumvirate approach has real benefits in terms of
shared wisdom, and we will continue to discuss the big decisions among
the three of us. But we have also agreed to clarify our individual
roles so there’s clear responsibility and accountability at the top of
the company,” Schmidt continues. In other words, he seems to be saying
that while he was CEO, it was really a joint effort among the three to
run the company. And now, in order to move quicker, they need one
leader to make the decisions. And that will be Page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the statement about moving quicker was Techcrunch’s conclusion, but
I agree. My business partner <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Brian</a> wrote
an
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/1-head-is-better-than-2-or-3-or-4-or-etc">article</a>
about this topic recently. His conclusion was also that one business
leader is better than many in an organization essentially because they
can make mistakes faster and pivot. Instead of wasting time try to
gather a consensus. I’m starting to agree more and more with this
sentiment. Reflect7 definitely moves slower than we should; I think
because of this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Do you have business partners? If so, how do you
run your company?</p>
