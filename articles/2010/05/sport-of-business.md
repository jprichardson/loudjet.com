The Sport of Business
=====================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyozby6hlp1qzbc4f.jpg)

As I have been
[thinking](http://loudjet.com/a/learning-pains) about our
latest
[decisions](http://loudjet.com/a/inspiration-is-not-perishable)
with the iPhone sports apps, the idea that sports and business have a
lot of common popped into my head; I think it’s rather intuitive.
Business and sports have so much in common: persistence, passion,
patience, perseverance, dedication, and competition.

What don’t they have in common? I like what Mark Cuban
[writes](http://blogmaverick.com/2005/05/30/success-and-motivation-you-only-have-to-be-right-once/)
about this:

In basketball you have to shoot 50pct. If you make an extra 10 shots per
hundred, you are an All-Star. In baseball you have to get a hit 30 pct
of the time. If you get an extra 10 hits per hundred at bats, you are on
the cover of every magazine, lead off every SportsCenter and make the
Hall of Fame.\
\
 In Business, the odds are a little different. You don’t have to break
the Mendoza line (hitting .200). In fact, it doesnt matter how many
times you strike out. In business, to be a success, you only have to be
right once.\
\
 One single solitary time and you are set for life. That’s the beauty of
the business world.

And that puts a little smile on my face. As I stated before, [I’m not in
this for the
money](http://loudjet.com/a/detoxify-your-life). Ya, I
want financial freedom. But the idea of being able to impact thousands
of people, if not millions, keeps me hustling. [We
must](http://loudjet.com/a/we-have-a-duty) do this, after
all, we only have to be right once.
