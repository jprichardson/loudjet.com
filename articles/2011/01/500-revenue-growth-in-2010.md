500% Revenue Growth in 2010
===========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_legv5jjuSc1qzbc4f.jpg)

When building a business it’s easy to look at the immediate moment to
judge the health of your business. If your revenue was down for the week
or even down for the last month, it’s even easier to wallow in the lack
of success your business has had. However, it’s more important to look
at the bigger picture. This is true for [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com).
The last few months have been slower, but this is expected as a majority
of our revenue comes from the season openers of college football and
NFL.

I’m pleased to announce that Reflect7 has had 500% revenue growth for
the year 2010. We still need to complete our baseball apps, finish our
ports onto the Android, and maybe visit the iPad. Let’s hope that 2011
is a prosperous year!
