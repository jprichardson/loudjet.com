Procrastination is the Thief of Time
====================================

> Procrastination is the thief of time. - Edward Young

In honor of [Martin Luther King
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day), I
thought it would be great to share a portion of his passage where he so
eloquently uses this quote:

> We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are
> confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum
> of life and history there is such a thing as being too late.
> Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us
> standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The “tide
> in the affairs of men” does not remain at the flood; it ebbs. We may
> cry out deperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf
> to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled
> residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: “Too
> late.” - Martin Luther King

To sum it up: don’t waste time, act now!
