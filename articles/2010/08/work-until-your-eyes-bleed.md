Work Until Your Eyes Bleed
==========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l809wqISP21qzbc4f.png)

Last week sucked. This week is hell already. I have two clients who are
pressing for results. Since the football season is starting real soon, I
have a constant barrage of emails about [our iPhone
apps](http://reflect7.com). But sometimes to launch a new project or
product it’s necessary to just kick your own ass. It sucks. But it’s
necessary. Progress begets progress. You need to build momentum.

It all starts with attitude. Develop a winner’s attitude, and you’ll
want to kick your own ass to win. Develop a losers attitude, and you’ll
lose before you start.

Kick your own ass, think positive, and work until your eyes bleed.
