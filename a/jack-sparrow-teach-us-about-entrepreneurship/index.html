<p>I was blissfully enjoying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean">The Pirates of
the Caribbean</a>
with my family and my ears perked up when Jack was having a conversation
with Elizabeth on the desserted island. Elizabeth said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…you’ll be positively the most fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to which Jack replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not just the Spanish Main, luv. The entire ocean. The entire world.
Wherever we want to go, we’ll go. That’s what a ship is, you know.
It’s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails, that’s what a
ship needs but what a ship is… what the Black Pearl really is… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew exactly what Jack was going to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…what the Black Pearl really is… is freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look for inspiration in about every aspect of my life. I could
probably be inspired by watching a cactus grow. However, this is
different. To quote Harry Beckwith: “Fiction teaches us about people.”
Seriously, it does. How about when Huckelberry Finn convinced everyone
it was fun to paint the fence? He taught us a bit about motivation. What
did The Great Gatsby teach us? It taught us about money and superficial
relationships. But, I digress. I can save that for another blog post.</p>
<p>Regardless, Jack Sparrow shows us that successful people persevere. In
every successful person’s biography, there are always tails of
perseverance. ALWAYS. <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/the-dream-gurbaksh-chahal">Gurbaksh

<a href="http://thesimpledollar.com">Trent Hamm</a>, and <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/delivering-happiness-review">Tony
Hseih</a>
all have this trait in common. Don’t forget it. When shit has you down,
remember, that to be successful, you have to be able to persevere.</p>
