Fight the Rewrite
=================

An old boss invited me to lunch yesterday. As we were sitting there
waiting for our food we were reminiscing over the early days of his
company. He made a statement that made me want to cringe:

> Ahhh, JP… I remember when you were looking at the code that Dan *[the
> first dev at the company]* wrote. You said: “This code is crap, it
> needs to be rewritten!”

I unfortunately didn’t have the gumption to tell him that I made a
mistake claiming that the code needed a rewrite. It’s true that I
thought the code was messy. But, in my anecdotal experience, it seems to
me that most developers that look at the code written by other
developers, think that the code is crap. Actually, developers that look
at their own code years later think that their own code is crap. They
are probably right; the code is crap.

**But, to believe that a rewrite is needed, is a *junior mistake*.**

There were business assumptions made that you can’t possibly know now.
Plenty of undocumented business assumptions that the code will handle
just fine. You can’t possibly account for all of them.

I like what Joel Spolsky writes on this, [Things You Should Never
Do](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html):

When you hire a developer, and he wants to rewrite code that seems to be
working just fine, fight it. He may claim that Java is old and slow and
that Ruby on Rails is cool. Maybe he’ll throw a bunch of buzzwords at
you.  Either way, really consider it.

What do you think?
