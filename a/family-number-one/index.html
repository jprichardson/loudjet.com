<p>Recently, <a href="http://reflect7.com">we</a> had a dinner meeting with some
potential clients that was worth a lot of money. I had my son that night
and I asked my fiance if she would stay with him (my fiance and I don’t
live together). We ended up staying out late… really late.</p>
<p>My fiance was very worried and very scared. I had neglected my
responsibilities as a fiance and as a father to let her know my plans. I
made a mistake. But what really bothers me is that I took them for
granted, albeit it was only for night, I still took them for granted.</p>
<p>My point is that we as entrepreneurs become so wrapped up in the next
deal, our customer complaints, business strategy, and a myriad of other
business duties that it’s so easy to put your family on the back burner.
Where would you be without them? I wouldn’t be half the man I am if it
wasn’t for my great family.</p>
<p>Please consider your family the next time a potential business issue
comes up. Consider that without your family support, being a successful
entrepreneur is very difficult. I know when I’m 90, I don’t want to

life</a>
with regret that I neglected my family responsibilities.</p>
