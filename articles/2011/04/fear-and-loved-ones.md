Fear and Loved Ones
===================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj8q0hYHI81qzbc4f.jpg)

I’ve learned something important recently. I’ve learned that the ones
closest in my life will doubt my aspirations and dreams. It’s not that
they don’t think that I can live out my dreams or accomplish my desires,
it’s that they are afraid of me failing and getting hurt. This all seems
very normal.

It’d be easy to listen to them. After all, they care about me; it’s
easier to trust someone when they know that they care about you. When
you were a child, if your mother told you not to put your hand on the
hot stove, it was for a very good reason. You trusted her, because after
all, she is your *mother*.

But, It’s important to not let the fears of our loved ones permeate our
drive. Our loved ones are not us. They are not entrepreneurs. They don’t
have the same thrill for risk that we do. They seek safety and refuge in
a steady paycheck, whereas we seek the hustling of business. They seek
promotions, benefits, and raises. We seek growth, the emotional roller
coaster, and profits.

They are not us. Their fear must be seen as just that. Ignore it and
prosper.
