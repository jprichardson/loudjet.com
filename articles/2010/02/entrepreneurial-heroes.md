Entrepreneurial Heroes
======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ky8m0pJR751qzbc4f.jpg)

I often take inspiration from entrepreneurs who have [made
it](http://blog.asmartbear.com/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html). I call
these my entrepreneurial heroes. These men are masters of their craft
and persistent until successful.

I present them to you in the order of influence on my life:

1.  **Jeff Atwood**: Jeff created blog called [Coding
    Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/). Since, I’m a software
    developer by trade, Jeff’s blog has influenced me in a number of
    positive ways. Most importantly though, is convincing me on the
    importance of design in software and how it affects the users. My
    favorite posts: [Peanut Butter Theory of User Interface
    Design](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/the-peanut-butter-theory-of-user-interface-design.html),
    [The Sesame Street Presentation
    Rule](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/the-sesame-street-presentation-rule.html),
    and [Fail Early, Fail
    Often](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/fail-early-fail-often.html).
    He’s also responsible for creating
    [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) - probably my favorite
    programming Q&A site. If you’re a software developer, you owe it to
    yourself to go back and dig in the CodingHorror’s archive. I promise
    it will change the way you think about your design.
2.  **Trent Hamm**: Trent created a blog called [The Simple
    Dollar](http://thesimpledollar.com). There was a time when I thought
    that using a credit card willy nilly was acceptable. Then I hit
    [financial
    armageddon](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/10/31/the-road-to-financial-armageddon-1-the-earliest-mistakes/).
    I knew that I had to cut back on spending money that I didn’t have.
    I searched and searched online until I hit The Simple Dollar. Trent
    often writes about personal improvement, focusing on your passion,
    and frugality. A must read for any aspiring entrepreneur. Some of my
    favorite posts: [The Path of Least Resistance is the Path Without
    Opportunities](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/09/07/the-path-of-least-resistance-is-the-path-without-opportunities/),
    [Find and Work Towards Your
    Passion](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/08/28/rule-11-find-and-work-toward-your-true-passions/),
    and [10 Financial Reasons to Turn Off the
    TV](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/09/ten-financial-reasons-to-turn-off-your-television-and-ten-things-to-replace-it-with/).
3.  **Mark Cuban**: Let’s see here… you probably know who Mark Cuban is.
    If you don’t, well he started out a small PC business repairing PCs,
    selling software, and focusing on small businesses. He sold that
    business. He then went on to found Broadcast.com. He sold
    Broadcast.com to Yahoo for a little over 4 billion dollars. He is
    now the outspoken owner of the Dallas Mavericks (NBA). Mark has a
    lot of great advice that any entrepreneur should heed. He often
    writes on his blog [Blog Maverick](http://blogmaverick.com/). My
    favorite posts: [How to Get
    Rich](http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/04/how-to-get-rich/), Success
    & Motivation
    [1](http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/23/success-and-motivation-part-1/),[2](http://blogmaverick.com/2004/04/25/success-and-motivation-part-2/),[3](http://blogmaverick.com/2004/05/07/success-and-motivation-part-3/),[4](http://blogmaverick.com/2004/05/25/success-and-motivation-p4/),
    and [You Only Have to Be Right
    Once](http://blogmaverick.com/2005/05/30/success-and-motivation-you-only-have-to-be-right-once/).
4.  **37 Signals** (Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson): These two
    guys own 37 Signals, a software company in Chicago that focuses on
    creating simple products that [underdo their
    competition](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php).
    They have a great blog called [Signals vs
    Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/). The blog focuses on design of
    software, business of software, and other misc. [silliness in the
    contemporary corporate business
    world](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2016-unicorns-and-projections).
    But, if you must read one piece of literature from them, then
    “[Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php)” is what
    it needs to be. Do yourself a favor and read it now. In fact, stop
    reading this, and just read the damn book. I promise you’ll be glad
    you did.
5.  **Gary Vaynerchuk**: This post would not be complete without
    mentioning [Gary](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/). Gary took over his
    family’s wine business and took it from just a few million dollars
    in a revenue a year to over 50 million. He frequently posts small,
    easily digestible inspirational videos on his website. I first heard
    of him when I went to [Big
    Omaha](http://blog.reflect7.com/2009/05/16/big-omaha-recap/) last
    year. Here is the
    [video](http://vaynermedia.com/gary-vaynerchuk-keynote-at-big-omaha/).
    His messages are simple: internet is killing traditional media, care
    and you’ll win, anyone can make a living off of their passion.

Who is your entrepreneurial hero?
