<h1>What Would Motivate You to Use MindSpread?</h1>

<p>Recently a commenter posted a reply on the original <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/announcing-mindspread">MindSpread
announcement</a>.
The commenter posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noble idea, but for me the question is this: Why do I need a web site
to buy a book and give it to somebody? Assuming I’m inclined to do it
in the first place, how much additional motivation is the web site
really going to give me? Why subject myself to the additional
complication of filling in the web form? How likely is it the people I
give the book to are going to bother updating the web site to tell me
where the book went after they read it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started typing my response but then felt that it made more sense to
make it a blog post because this response needs feedback as well.</p>
<p>I should first start out by pointing that the you don’t need the website
to buy a book. I know the commenter knew that, but for you new readers
that fact may not be clear. Allow me to address the first question: why
you need a website to give a book. You don’t. You don’t need MindSpread
to give a book like you don’t need Facebook to stay in contact with your
friends, in the same way that you don’t need Amazon to buy merchandise,
in the same way that you dont need eBay to sell goods, in the same way
you don’t need Youtube or Hulu to watch TV, and in the same way you
don’t need Wikipedia for information. No, you don’t need MindSpread at
all.</p>
<p>It’s time for the million dollar question. Why would you use MindSpread?
What does MindSpread offer you? When you buy a book and read it, what do
you do with it when you are finished? Most likely it sits on your
bookshelf for years untouched. What if you could give it to someone and
it would make a difference in their life? What if you could give it to
someone and know that they will give it someone else and so on and so
forth? What if you had a website that could track all of this and you
could see your positive impact upon the world?</p>
<p>Yes, chances are there will be people who do not spread the books after
they have received them. This can be solved in two ways. Technologically
and socially. MindSpread could send them an email monthly reminding them
to spread the book. MindSpread could integrate with Facebook Connect so
that people would know who is not spreading books when they receive
them.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think that technology is the best solution to the
problem. That’s why MindSpread will be a non-profit/charity with
open-source code. MindSpread’s users will own MindSpread. MindSpread’s
users will be responsible for instilling passion amongst their peers and
the receivers of the books. MindSpread’s users will control MindSpread’s
fate. It’s about giving.</p>
<p>Remember MindSpread’s mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To encourage the spreading of knowledge and culture throughout the
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would use MindSpread for the same reason that you may help your
neighbor shovel his drive way, for the same reason you might serve food
at a homeless shelter, for the same reason that you might answer a
question on a forum, for the same reason you might take time out of your
day to listen to a friend who is hurting, for the same reason that you
might donate food to charity. Helping other and giving makes us feel
good. So what does MindSpread offer you? Altruism.
Selflessness. MindSpread offers you a chance to make a difference.</p>
