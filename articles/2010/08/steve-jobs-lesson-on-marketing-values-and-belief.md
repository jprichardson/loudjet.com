Steve Jobs Lesson on Marketing: Values and Belief
=================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7ybb6N3uD1qzbc4f.jpg)

I recently discovered this video of Steve Jobs circa 1997. The main
message of the video is that of marketing is based upon values. His
first detailed point is that it’s not about “megahertz” or “megabytes”
it’s about values. Marketing is about who you are and what you stand
for.

Apple’s Core Value:

“We believe that people with passion, can change the world.” “Those
people that are crazy enough to believe they can change the world, are
the ones that do.” - Steve Jobs

Absolutely brilliant and inspirational. 

Here’s the video:

I’m also reminded of Simon Sinek’s TED talk. It’s quite possible that
Simon even based his whole book upon this thesis - which is “[Start with
the
Why](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591842808).”
You need to watch this too:

What is your purpose? What is your belief? Communicate that.
