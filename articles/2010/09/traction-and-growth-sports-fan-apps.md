Traction and Growth: Sports Fan Apps
====================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8chilkUev1qzbc4f.png)

[Thefreedictionary.com](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/traction)
defines traction as the following:

> 1. The act of drawing or pulling, especially the drawing of a vehicle
> or load over a surface by motor power.
>
> 2. Adhesive friction, as of a wheel on a track or a tire on a road

[What is traction in a
startup](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/2797/what-does-traction-really-mean)?
When building a startup it’s essential to achieve traction. I define
traction simply as getting a certain number of paying customers over a
period of time. Obviously each industry can’t define traction as such,
e.g. Facebook doesn’t have paying customers. But as a founder, you must
know how to define traction for your business. In short, I think that
you can say that you have traction when you’ve proven your business
model.

I believe that Reflect7 has finally seen some traction. This last week
was the opening weekend for NCAA football. If you didn’t already know,
Reflect7 [creates iPhone apps for sports
fans](http://reflect7.com/apps/football-fan-apps). 

Here are our daily sales at this time last year:

Approximately a whopping \$195.

Here are our daily sales for the opening weekend this year:

Approximately \$2500, a 12.5x growth! Now granted we do have more apps
in the store this year then we did last year. But the most popular apps
are still seeing much more downloads then they did last year. It’s a
good thing [we didn’t
quit](http://loudjet.com/a/learning-pains).

We’re slowly expanding into the Android and the Blackberry… so who knows
where the following year will take us! But the important point is that
you need to achieve traction and growth, if you’re not… you may want to
consider to pivot or change business models.
