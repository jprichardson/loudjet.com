The Success Formula of Angry Birds
==================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgcwxrWdkC1qzbc4f.png)

If you’re not familiar with [Angry
Birds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds), it’s currently one of
the most popular mobile games. It has been download over [50 million
times](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/how-angry-birds-really-took-off-200m-minutes-a-day-spent-playing-it-20110208-1akt5.html); over
[200 million
minutes](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/how-angry-birds-really-took-off-200m-minutes-a-day-spent-playing-it-20110208-1akt5.html)
are spent playing the game every day. The game has everything that you’d
expect of a successful mobile game. 

I’ve heard people ascribe the success of Angry Birds to luck. I’ve also
heard others state that they didn’t think Angry Birds would cost much to
develop. But it’s all BS. Angry Birds success is not do to luck and it
wasn’t cheap to develop. In fact, according to this
[interview](http://mobilewebgo.com/how-did-angry-birds-become-blockbuster-rovio-video-interview-and-transcript),
Angry Birds cost over \$100k to develop the initial version.

The Sunday Telegraph in London wrote an [article detailing the company,
Rovio](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/how-angry-birds-really-took-off-200m-minutes-a-day-spent-playing-it-20110208-1akt5.html).
I want to highlight some excerpts:

Ahh, so they noticed a change in their market. Mark Cuban
[wrote](http://blogmaverick.com/2010/02/23/how-to-get-rich-part-1a/)
about this before: “Look for uncertainty and change in your business.”
That was their first move to success.

They built a game that tells a story. The protagonists are little birds
that have funny angry facial expressions, the antagonists are evil green
pigs who apparently stole the birds’ eggs. Seth Cohen would agree that
[this is important](http://blog.asmartbear.com/tell-me-a-story.html).

They’ve made the game simple. People love simple games. I think that’s
what’s made Tetris and Bejeweled so successful, and that’s what’s making
some iPhone games successful. People love simplicity because it’s
inviting. It doesn’t take much brainpower to figure out. You can just
open up the game start playing for a few minutes and then quit.

So they had a lot of experience. They watched and analyzed their
customers; they took notes. They persisted in the development of their
games.

They noticed the importance of marketing and branding. These catapult
games have been around [for
awhile](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=catapult#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=catapult+castle+games&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1).
They noticed what Apple liked and built a strong brand.

Finally, they eliminated luck.

In summary, Rovio did the following:

1.  Noticed an emerging change in the market.
2.  Told a story.
3.  Built a strong brand.
4.  Marketed.
5.  Made a simple and intuitive product.
6.  Leveraged their years of experience.
7.  Analyzed customer behavior.
8.  Persisted.
9.  Spent a lot of money.
10. Eliminated luck.

Reads like a textbook case for success.
