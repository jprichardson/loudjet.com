Timely Correspondence
=====================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfkynz70k51qzbc4f.gif)

When a friend contacts you, how long do you take to respond? How about
your wife, client, or boss? The longer you take, the more it shows to
that other person that they arenâ€™t valued to you.

We live in a world where instant responses are expected.

I think these are good response times:

**Phone Call**: Same day to 24 hours max. \
**Email**: Within an hour to same day max. \
**Text Message**: 10 mins to two hours max.

Cut these times in half if you initiated the correspondence. Think about
your actions and the messages that they send. If someone values you
enough to reach out to you, you \*owe\* it to them to respond in a
timely manner.
