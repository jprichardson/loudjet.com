Forget the Shiny Tech, Focus on the Customer Experience
=======================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqsxc4Ipo11qzbc4f.jpg)

I’m always amazed when I discover a new piece of technology or software.
Usually, thousands of business ideas start pouring into my head on how I
can build a cool product. Most recently, the thought of
[Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/), [Mailgun](http://mailgun.net/), and
[Sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com/) came to mind. 

An internal dialogue raged on in my mind:

> “SMS and email are some of the most ubiquitous communication tools,
> not to mention very pervasive.”
>
>  ”What could I build quickly to monetize and spread virally?”
>
> “Focus, you fool…”
>
> “You’re in the process of selling [one company](http://reflect7.com)
> and you just [started another](http://gitpilot.com). Plus, no one
> really cares about how you’re using cool tech.”

And then I dropped the thought.

This has happened to me time and time again. In fact, that’s how
Reflect7 was founded. I knew the iPhone would be hot. I knew that
consumers would purchase them by the ton. I just didn’t know what apps
to develop for it yet. Eventually we settled on sports’ apps, but we
didn’t consider the customer experience until the end.

I finally had this realization of all of this when I stumbled upon this
video:

It was Steve Jobs who made it crystal clear as to what I had done. I was
thinking a lot about the technology and how I could sell that, rather
than consider customer problems and how I could build products that
delivered a superb experience. This is what
[Gitpilot](http://gitpilot.com) will do.
