<h1>Selling Is All About Relationships</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7dpwmFxpQ1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As some of you may know, I’m engaged and will be getting married on June
24th, 2011. We were searching for a DJ for our wedding reception and
found many. I was thinking that if a DJ is going to entertain an event
that occurs on what is suppose to be the most important day of my life,
I should be able to meet with him before I commit. I called one of the
highly-rated local DJ companies and asked if I could meet with a
particular DJ. They told me that they typically don’t allow that, and
that I could come to their office and meet with management. I even
explained him my rationale - they still wouldn’t allow it. I called
another DJ company - <a href="http://www.bandstandmusic.com/">Bandstand</a>,
although not as highly rated as the first, they understood my point and
didn’t have a problem with me meeting Mark the DJ. After I got off the
phone with the owner, I felt really good about the company. Mark called
and was very cordial. I no longer even felt the need to have to meet him
before we signed the contract. I knew that this was the company that I
wanted to DJ my wedding reception.</p>
<p>Bandstand had sold me by being empathetic to my rationale and by
managing their relationship with my fiance. Before I had stepped in and
told my fiance that I wanted to meet with whomever the DJ would be for
our wedding, another owner stayed in touch with my fiance. They
effectively made my fiance and I feel good about them.</p>
<p>Why do we forget that selling is about relationships and feelings? I do
it often as well. Maybe because it actually takes a lot of effort, I’m
really not sure. But it works. You can use your personal relationship
with your customers to achieve more sales. I don’t mean “use” as take
advantage, I just mean that you can be empathetic, courteous, and build
a positive relationship with your customers, and you’ll sell more. It’s
that simple.</p>
