Social Media and Priorities
===========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lccg25Lkzt1qzbc4f.jpg)

If you had asked me a year ago if you or your business should be
engaging in social media, I would have responded with a resounding
‘YES!’ I believed that it would give you a ‘leg up’ on your competition.
That you could’ve easily engaged with your customers. That you could’ve
started conversations.

Recently, my [schedule has changed
drastically](http://loudjet.com/a/changing-schedules-can-force-productivity).
I use to go to bed every night around 1 AM to 2 AM and then I would wake
up around 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. I noticed that when I would allow myself
to stay up that late, I would procrastinate my tasks until the end of
the night, sometimes forcing myself to stay up until even 3:00 AM. Now,
I get up around 4:45 AM and go to bed around 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM. But
every weekday, I get up at 4:45 AM. I now feel that more than ever, I
must prioritize my time.

When I look at my Facebook status stream or Twitter feed, I’ve noticed
that most people post pointless shit. The exception on Facebook is, that
I can hide all updates from people that I’m not as close to; also, I may
be a bit more interested in my close friends inane updates.\* However,
on Twitter, it feels that 99.9% of the updates from people are
pointless. I doubt many care that you got a flat tire or that you just
bought a super new laser printer. I’ve come to realize that most of
social media is just noise.

I first thought about this after Leo Leparte
[wrote](http://leoville.com/buzz-kill) about how no one noticed when he
stopped updating. What does that say? To quote Leo (emphasis mine):

> It makes me feel like everything I’ve posted over the past four years
> on Twitter, Jaiku, Friendfeed, Plurk, Pownce, and, yes, Google Buzz,
> has been an immense waste of time. ***I was shouting into a vast echo
> chamber where no one could hear me because they were too busy shouting
> themselves.*** All this time I’ve been pumping content into the void
> like some chatterbox Onan. How humiliating. How demoralizing.

Coincidentally, as I was about to write this, Jonathan Fields [wrote
something similar
today](http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/is-twitter-the-ultimate-creation-killer/).
He says:

> I’ve recently spent a lot of time interviewing some of the most
> productive and successful creators on the planet. And, I’ve noticed
> something…many hardcore creators aren’t on social media.

and…

> Social media is great for building my tribe, seeding my creations and
> fanning the flames once they’re in the real world. It’s great to stay

That’s just it. It’s a distraction. It’s noise. This doesn’t mean that
it can’t be useful. It all comes down to priorities. If you’re trying to
build a small business and you have three hours a night to do it. Where
do you spend your time? Do you write code? Do you respond to customer
emails? Do you Tweet? I see it as an issue of priorities, and at this
time, social media is not one of them.

What do you think?

\*I realize that this is a two-side street as I probably also post
stupid shit to most people.
