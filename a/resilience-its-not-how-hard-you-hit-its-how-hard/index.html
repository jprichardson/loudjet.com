<h1>Resilience: It&#39;s Not How Hard You Hit, It&#39;s How Hard You Can Get Hit And Keep Moving Forward</h1>
<p>About a year ago, Reflect7 was gaining massive momentum with our sports
apps. Right when we were at the top, we took a roundhouse kick to the
face from Apple. Having our apps denied twice in a row was almost our
deathblow. Our egos took the hit as the control over our own destiny
appeared to slip away…</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Blocks > Real Blocks</strong></p>
<p>After several rejections, the end was nigh. My biggest fear, and
probably JP’s and Corey’s, was that Apple would reject our apps again
after we had revised them to Apple’s stated needs. <em>Looking back, my
actual fear was straight up rejection.</em> Being told “No, you can’t do
this anymore.”</p>
<p>Fear is a strong motivator not to do something. This is when the excuses
and rationalizations start pouring in. Backwards rationalizating the
strategy of taking alternative action for fear of rejection is something
I’ve been guilty of many times. Nothing preps the ego for flight like
the possibility of being rejected. </p>
<p><strong>Resiliency\
</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure.”
-Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that ignorance needs to be balanced with
reasoning. At one point, the problem really was our apps and we had to
be vigilant enough to realize that. Ignorance, in Twain’s terms, is more
of a blindness towards restraints. Having an anything is possible
outlook with the confidence to follow through.</p>
<p>Mr. Twain has held my hand as I’ve been rejected by a slew of girls,
ebay, usps, supply chains, teachers, etc. I got through all of those
with little scarring. Why couldn’t Reflect7 get through this with just a
few bruises? All we needed to do was be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorant: consider that the true problem was a lack of communication
after we had revised our apps.</li>
<li>Confident: assume that Apple wanted to work with us because we are a
quality company with quality apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turned out, more communication clarified what could have been a
crippling situation. We took the hits and kept moving forward. It was a
pivotal victory for our team - it was one of the first times that we
stood up after getting knocked down.</p>
<p><strong>The Take Away</strong></p>
<p>What I’ll try to remember next time we’re dealt a big blow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t automatically assume the negative when something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Don’t take it personal. </li>
<li>If your going to assume something, assume that everyone is going to
agree once more information is presented.</li>
<li>Shit happens, but it’s how you deal with it that makes or breaks
you.</li>
