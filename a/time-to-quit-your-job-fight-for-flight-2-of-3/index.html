<h1>Time to Quit Your Job: Fight For Flight (2 of 3)</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4cpe4BUdm1qzbc4f.jpg" alt="Airplane taking
off"></p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, then you’ve taken the first step to creating
a business you’re passionate about. You have <a href="http://techneur.com/post/707087897/time-to-quit-your-job-the-motivation-part-1-of-3" title="Time to Quite Your Job Part 1">The
Motivation</a>
and now it’s time to set the plan. Remember, your business doesn’t have
to be a mattress-filler when it comes to money, just something that you
love to do. If you love it, people will recognize your love and success
will follow.</p>
<p>Whatever your scenario, someone else has been in a scenario twice as bad
and came out to create a business they loved. There’s no excuse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Henry Ford*</strong>failed and went broke five times before he succeeded.*</p>
<p><strong>Walt Disney*</strong>was fired by a newspaper editor because “he lacked
imagination and had no good ideas.” He went bankrupt several times
before he built Disneyland. In fact, the proposed park was rejected by
the city of Anaheim on the grounds that it would only attract
riffraff.*</p>
<p><strong><br>-</strong><a href="http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/efficacynotgiveup.html">But They Did Not Give
Up</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Clear the runway</strong></p>
<p>There’s no way your business can get off the ground unless the runway is
clear. That means not having to worry about the impending doom of bills
and debt. Most Debt falls into 4 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Credit Card</li>
<li>Car Loans</li>
<li>Student Loans</li>
<li>Home Loans</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start with the two largest and most controllable items: Car &amp; Home
Loans. Time to downsize. A decent car that can get you from A to B only
costs about \$6-8k. I obtained my ‘06 Kia Spectra on ebay for \$7,500
with only 18k miles. Remember, having a cheaper car will also decrease
your insurance rate.</p>
<p>Home Loans are an unnecessary burden. Purchase a home once you’ve got
your business figured out. If you don’t, you’ll always be a slave to the
system. My Sister and her husband purchased a house five years ago. My
Brother-in-law now faces the possibility of a layoff and the prospect of
having to sell. It’s a bad situation, but as long as you have that nice
home, don’t expect to quit your day job - there’s too much on the line.</p>
<p>So what do you do? Take the home off the line. Sell. Downsize to a
rental. Will having a nice house offset the <a href="http://techneur.com/post/707087897/time-to-quit-your-job-the-motivation-part-1-of-3" title="The Motivation">pain you
feel</a>
from having a horrible job? Probably not. The only thing that nice house
is good for is keeping you committed to the same shit job you hate. A
job that, probably, isn’t as secure as you think.</p>
<p>As for student loan and credit card debt, there’s no simple solution
except to pay it down as fast as possible. You can accelerate the
process by getting rid of the stuff you don’t need.</p>
<p><strong>Jettison The Dead Weight</strong></p>
<p>You can clear the runway but if you’re carrying around a lot of smaller
monthly expenses, you won’t be able to take off. Cell phone bills, cable
bills, XBox Live subscriptions, etc. Make a list of all of your monthly
expenses (hook your bank account up to
<a href="http://Mint.com" title="Mint.com">Mint.com</a> and it will do it for you) and
start crossing things off.</p>
<p>​1) You don’t need cable tv. I’ve been without cable for the last 9
years and I’m doing just fine. Besides, most of the content is legally
online.</p>
<p>​2) Go down to a bare-bones cell phone bill. Do you really need a data
plan? Do you really need to surf the net? If it increases your
productivity, then go for it. Otherwise, downsize.</p>
<p>​3) Get roommates. There’s no better way to halve your rent and utility
bills then by getting a friend to go in half. Sure, you may be cramped
and the dishes might not get done, but that is a small price to pay for
the monetary gain.</p>
<p>​4) Buy generic-brand food and clothes and go out to eat less
frequently. You hear this all of the time but it does help. Change the
big stuff first. House and car, then rent, then cable, then phone, then
the little stuff.</p>
<p>So we’ve covered services and tangibles that you can measure. Other dead
weight exists in a more ephemeral form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time-intensive hobbies. These are distractions like XBox 360 or
watching your favorite TV shows. Sure, they’re fun, but they don’t
net you anything towards your dream. And when you create that dream
job, you won’t need to escape to have fun because you’ll be having
fun at work. You’ll do your job because you love to, not because you
need to buy the next installment of Halo. So stop wasting time at
night and start creating something. Hobbies you really love
shouldn’t stand in the way. If you love Halo or widget-making that
much, then that is what your business should be. Anybody who doesn’t
think you can’t make a living off of the crazy stuff you love needs

by Gary Vaynerchuk.</li>
<li>Toxic friends. Friends that only take and don’t give. It’s time to
look at who you’re hanging around and decide if these people are
helping or hurting you. “<em>Show me your friends and I’ll show you
your future</em>” - Unknown. When you hang around others who are
motivated and hold high values, you’ll find those characteristics
rubbing off.</li>
<li>Clutter. Get rid of all of the shit that you don’t use. If you
haven’t used it in a year, sell it or give it to the goodwill. “<em>The
things you own, end up owning you.</em>” -Tyler Durden from Fight Club.
Getting rid of physical clutter helps clear away mental clutter.</li>
<li>You’re job. If you have your expenses minimized, downsize your job.
Make sure you make enough to pay the bills, but also make sure that
your new job gives you the freedom to work on your passion in your
spare time (or at that job). Also, make sure it minimizes your
responsibilities so you aren’t bringing it home with you every
night. This will give you the energy to focus on your true passion.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is no easy process. For some, Fighting For Flight could take a year
or two. In the end, it’s just a step. A step where you can look back and
say you got in the cockpit, behind the wheel, while others just watched
you fly by.</p>
