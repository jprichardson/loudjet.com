Saddened by Steve's Departure
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqhmd2mPpd1qzbc4f.jpg)

Who would have expected that many would be saddened by a CEO’s departure
from a company? I wouldn’t. But on many of the net forums, people are
expressing a bit of melancholy. I feel the same.

It’s not because Steve is some big, bad, powerful man [he is]… no, it’s
because Steve took Apple from the brink of bankruptcy to briefly being
the most valuable company in the world (currently the 2nd behind Exxon
Mobile). He did this all while giving us products that we as consumers
love.

You see, Apple represented what we love about a good story. Apple was
David the underdog. Microsoft was the evil goliath that could not be
defeated. Apple innovated. They help to revolutionize the music
industry, the computer industry, and the smartphone. I hope that they
are just getting started.

As an entrepreneur, Steve Jobs represents exactly what an entrepreneur
should be. One who is focused on the present while simultaneously
holding a vision. One who cares about simplicity and not just producing
another “me-to” product. One who wants to change lives.

I truly believe that history will remember him as this century’s Henry
Ford. Or better yet, he has set a new standard, one that I’ll always be
inspired from.

Farewell.
