<h1>What the Successful Will Do that You Won&#39;t</h1>

<p>Watch this short Stephen Colbert interview of Mark Cuban:</p>
<p>Did you catch the part about how Mark Cuban sold milk powder door to
door? According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">his Wikipedia
entry</a>, he’s sold garbage bags,
stamps, and even started a chain letter that netted him over \$1000.
Richard Branson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson">sold magazines out of the trunk of his
car</a>. <a href="http://www.felixdennis.com/about/dennis-publishing/">Felix Dennis
started a small magazine on Bruce
Lee</a> eventually
building the publishing empire behind Maxim, Blender, and The Weekly.
Gary Vaynerchuk s<a href="http://www.phare-conference.eu/programme/gary-vaynerchuk/">old baseball cards and operated a bunch of lemonade
stands</a>.
Steve Jobs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">returned Coke bottles for
money</a>!</p>
<p>Sebastian Marshall calls this the <a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/the-knack-for-getting-money">“knack for getting money” or
“hustling”</a>.
He uses 50 Cent as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at 50 Cent – he’s sold around 40 million records… I don’t know
what his cut is per album sold, but he probably made more money from
the Glaceau Vitamin Water deal than he has from records.</p>
<p>He’s got skills, he’s got drive, and he works hard. But lots of
musicians have skill, drive, and work hard. What sets him apart is
that 50′s got no hangups about getting money.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastmarsh/5418341182/" title="twittertweet by sebastmarsh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5012/5418341182_6a5242e6be.jpg" alt="twittertweet"></a></p>
<p>How many platinum selling artists are willing to go shovel snow for
100 bucks?</p>
<p>Probably the biggest thing that holds people back from getting money
are hangups about it. How do you get over that?</p>
<p>Practice? Philosophy? Desperation?</p>
<p>Probably all of them. But I’d bet on the guy with no hangups about
getting money and a little drive getting more money faster than
someone with tons of skills but hangups about it. There’s silly
amounts of opportunity all over the place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of these odd money-making methods were done out of desperation and
necessity, with the exception of 50 Cent of course. But that’s just
it. The successful don’t have hangups about making money. They’ll just
do it without thinking about it.</p>
<p>You can become good at making money too. It just takes practice. Jason
Fried founder of 37Signals wrote an article in Inc magazine on <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried.html">how to
get good at making
money</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like I said at the outset, it’s all about practice. Whether you’re
playing drums or building a business, you’re going to be pretty bad at
something the first time you try it. The second time isn’t much
better. Over time, and after a lot of practice, you begin to get
there.</p>
<p>So here’s a great way to practice making money: Buy and sell the same
thing over and over on Craigslist or eBay. Seriously.</p>
<p>Go buy something on Craigslist or eBay. Find something that’s a bit of
a commodity, so you know there’s always plenty of supply and demand.
An iPod is a good test. Buy it, and then immediately resell it. Then
buy it again. Each time, try selling it for more than you paid for it.
See how far you can push it. See how much profit you can make off 10
transactions.</p>
<p>Start tweaking the headline. Then start fiddling with the product
description. Vary the photographs. Take some pictures of the thing for
sale; use other photos with other items, or people, in them. Shoot
really high-quality shots, and also post crappy ones from your
cell-phone camera. Try every variation you can think of.</p>
<p>I love doing this, because there’s no real risk involved. If you
already have a business, you don’t need to dream up a new product line
or rock the boat with crazy experiments. If you don’t have a business,
it’s a perfect way to work on your chops.</p>
