I'm Back
========

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo6i4wJnZo1qzbc4f.jpg)

It’s been an interesting couple of months. Quite a few things have
happened in my life.

-   I got married to a wonderful [woman and my best
    friend](http://techneur.com/post/542183349/family-number-one).
-   [Reflect7 has been put up for
    sale.](https://flippa.com/146371-2-yr-old-mobile-application-software-company-35-644-profit-in-2010-autopilot)
-   [I started two new companies.](http://gitpilot.com/)
-   My biological father who I haven’t seen in 26 years has contacted
    me.
-   My house was burglarized. Three laptops, an iPad, a PS3, and wedding
    gift cards were stolen. More on this in another post this week.

Why did I stop blogging? I wanted to use all of my free time to either
focus on my business activities in the name of increased productivity or
spend my free time on wedding related activities. You see, some blog
posts would take up to two hours to write. Many would take over an hour
to write. It was a massive commitment that I didn’t want to stress
about. So it seemed reasonable to take a blogging sabbatical.

I missed writing though. There is something magical about writing that
really helps a person to organize their thoughts and bring direction to
one’s life.

I’m back and I feel better than ever.
