Pay Per Check-In: Adsense in the real world.
============================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh1ze5rcfJ1qzbc4f.jpg)

About 8 months ago, we were discussing different app directions and
a provocative idea came up: if we could direct traffic to
establishments, we could charge those establishments for every person
that
[checked-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check-in#Social_check-in "Wiki: check-in").

I’m sure we weren’t the first to come up with such an idea. In fact,
it’s an age-old form of marketing. Every week, business’s pay upfront to
put their coupon in a local mailer. Potential customers see the coupon,
and business’s grade their campaign’s success by tracking every coupon
that is redeemed. Pretty basic. What’s fascinating now, is that gps
technology allows business’s to more accurately pay for what they want -
real customers - with minimal overhead.

With Pay Per Check-In (PPCI), business’s wouldn’t have to risk paying
high up-front costs. If no one checks-in using the system, the business
pays nothing. If N number of people check-in using the system, the
business pays N x R, where R is a previously agreed-upon rate. Payment
is made as you go so funding doesn’t have to be upfront. With this
model, the business’s risk is dramatically lowered.

In the pay-for-what-you-get sense, PPCI is similar to a real-world
version of Adsense. Instead of eyeballs, your currency is people.
Instead of online sales, your directing traffic to brick and mortar
stores. Foursquare might seem like a close model to this but it
tracks/reinforces loyalty much more than it directs traffic.

Imagine teaming up with a promoter in your city to build a nightlife
application. You could offer your users (1) the utility of the nightlife
schedule on a mobile platform, and (2) drink/food specials for
checking-in. Throw in some game mechanics and you have a potential boon
promoting the nightlife industry.

So what do you think? Is PPCI the next phase for online to offline
sales? Is this a viable pivot for Foursquare to monetize?

Let me know your thoughts,
