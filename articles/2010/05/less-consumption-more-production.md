Less Consumption, More Production
=================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l39vpcs6co1qzbc4f.jpg)

I have a weakness that I need to improve upon. I need to improve upon it
NOW. When I wake up in the morning and sit down to my computer I read
Slashdot, Proggit, Hacker News, Techcrunch, Mashable, Little Things
Matter, Signals vs Noise, The Simple Dollar, Seth Godin’s blog, and A
VC. These are blogs/sites that are typically updated daily. I have a
whole list of sites that I read that aren’t updated as frequently:
Feld’s Thoughts, Steve Blank’s Blog, Quick Sprout, Derek Siver’s blog,
Coding Horror, The Next Web, A Smart Bear, Illuminated Mind, and
Silicon Prairie News. I probably spend at least two hours a day on these
sites. This doesn’t include the time spent checking site analytics,
browsing through Facebook, reading Tweets, etc. When it comes down to
it, I love to read. Reading makes me feel like I’m in the “know.” Maybe,
when I feel like I’m in the ‘know’, I feel like I’m in more control? I
don’t know.

One thing is for sure, a lot of my time is spent on consumption. More
time is spent than what’s necessary. As an entrepreneur my value is
measured by production. My customers don’t care if I know what the ideal
situations are for using NoSQL or a relational DB. They don’t care if I
can recite Gary Vaynerchuk’s whole entire keynote including the small
stories of his childhood in Belarus, They don’t care if I know who the
CEO is of most of the companies featured in the social media. They care
about what I can produce to improve their life. That’s what
entrepreneurs do. They convert their time into products or services that
will hopefully generate revenue.

I need to remember my
[priorities](http://loudjet.com/a/dont-have-the-time) and
produce accordingly. I need to remember my value as entrepreneur is
measured by my output or production. I need to start to think about this
in terms of a ratio of output hours to input hours. I’m not sure what
the ideal number is, but I do know that it should be much greater than
1.0 every day… probably even greater than 3.0. Right now, most days I’m
above 1.0, but… I know some days I’m not. I will call this my production
number.\*

I challenge myself to an experiment. For two weeks, I will only allow
myself to view each one of the aforementioned sites once in a day. I
will however be allowed to check Facebook/Twitter anytime during a
downtime such as waiting in an office, riding in a car, etc. I don’t
have much of a problem with them anyways. I will only be allowed to view
sites in my RSS reader or ones that are linked from Slashdot, HN, or
Proggit. For most people this doesn’t sound like much of a problem, but
for me this should boost my production number… and that’s what is
important. (Maybe I should track it too?)

Remember, as an entrepreneur, you need to stay sharp, but your value is
measured in what you produce. What are your thoughts on this?

\* Let’s assume that in a day I spend 1.5 hours consuming and 4 hours
producing. My production number would then be 4/1.5 = 2.67
