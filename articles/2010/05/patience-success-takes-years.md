Patience: Success Takes Years
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l32fjbKmot1qzbc4f.jpg)

When I wrote the article “[the Sport of
Business](http://loudjet.com/a/sport-of-business)”, I
highlighted similarities and one key difference between business and
sports. [Nate Lowry](http://twitter.com/natelowry) responded with a
comment that prompted me to recall one of [Gary
Vaynerchuk’s](http://garyvaynerchuk.com) mantras. Gary says that when
building a business, you’re running a marathon. I know that I forget
this all too often. 

Most scientists estimate it took the ancient Egyptians decades to build
the pyramids. What if they just quit after a year? We wouldn’t have the
modern marvels that we do today. We would know less about ancient
architecture. We give up too early.

I really like
what [DHH](http://twitter.com/dhh) [writes](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1624-overnight-success-takes-years)
about success:

From the outside, it often seems like certain companies or products just
blow up unannounced and become huge overnight. In reality, it rarely
works like that. It certainly didn’t for us.\
\
 …\
\
 It wasn’t enough to make us blow up overnight, though. To get today’s
levels we’ve relied on the compound interest of attention. Every year a
steady stream of new readers and customers have joined the flock while
still keeping the bulk from the year before.\
\
 That’s why it annoys me dearly when our advice is discounted with “that
only works for you because you’ve got this massive success to roll
from”. That “massive” success was built convert by convert. Nobody
handed it to us. We’re sharing exactly how we got there and hoping that
our experiences and discoveries will help get you to where you want to
be as well.\
\
 So stop thinking that you can’t get there because you don’t have a huge
audience already. Start building that audience today. Start getting
people interested in what you have to say. Then in a few years time
you’ll get to chuckle about your overnight success as well.

[Jeff Atwood](http://twitter.com/codinghorror) also wrote a [great
article](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/overnight-success-it-takes-years.html)
on this as well.

This is something we must remember. To be successful we must work at it
every single day. We must make small improvements in our product, our
brand, our relationships, ourselves EVERYDAY. One day, we will wake up
too… and we’ll realize that we’ll be successful. [How bad do you want
