<p>Aaron wrote an article titled “<a href="http://www.aaronstannard.com/post/2010/06/12/The-Myth-of-the-Single-Person-Startup.aspx">The Myth of the Single Person
Startup</a>.”
His story is about how he took a month off of work to launch a startup
by himself and then failed. My goal is to point out all of the mistakes
that he made and that he doesn’t realize. I’m not trying to do this to
be a pompous ass, as I am not successful by societal’s monetary
standards, yet. I also want others to be aware of people’s anecdotes.
With that being said, you need to read the entire article before you
proceed, as my commentary will make little sense if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Mistakes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Aaron believed that he could launch a startup and be profitable in a
month. This is possible if we leave our definition of profitability
at revenue minus expenses. If your expenses are your \$20 monthly
server and you consider your time free, you could write some iPhone
apps and be profitable almost right away. But, I think most people
consider the definition of profitability when you achieve enough
profit to start paying for most of your expenses. Otherwise known as
ramen-noodle profitable.</li>
<li>He wanted to spend his entire month coding. I made this mistake on
my second startup. I really believed the “if you build it, they will
come” line. It’s BS, you have to be talking to potential customers
to validate their problems and your potential solutions. That is, if
you’re not solving your own problem. Aaron doesn’t tell us what he’s
building. But the fact remains, spending all of your time coding is
a recipe for disaster. I know, I know, it’s a lot of fun, but you
can’t do it. I really recommend that people research Steve Blank’s
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation">Customer Development
Methodology</a>. </li>
<li>Being a good software engineer, he thought could build a kick-ass
product that meant user requirements and that’s all he would do. The
book the E-Myth writes about this rationale. Many people fall victim
to this line of thinking, they just think about the fun part, e.g.
writing code for a month. they often forget about what else is
important in a business: marketing, accounting, discussing your
ideas, contacting customers, etc.</li>
<li>After twelve days of writing code, he scrapped everything. Very bad
idea. Entrepreneurs need to focus on the <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">minimum viable
product</a>
(MVP). He should have
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/fear-of-shipping.html">shipped</a>
at twelve days to guage customer feedback.</li>
<li>Dude… Aaron: why are you creating UML diagrams when you have only
one month? See point #4. This is over-engineering. <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/mvp-galls-law">It’s all about
the MVP, Obey Gall’s
Law</a>.</li>
<li>He thought he could do this in one month. I know, I mentioned this
in #1, but it’s the biggest mistake of all. This shit takes time.
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/patience-success-takes-years">It takes
years</a>!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In Defense of Aaron</strong></p>
<p>OK, so Aaron learned one lesson out of all of this, and perhaps it is
the most important lesson of all. It’s not that he necessarily should
have had a co-founder, but it’s that he should have been talking about
his idea since day one. I think he realizes that.</p>
<p>I would like to think that Aaron learned a lot more too. More about
code, more about himself. Hopefully, he had a bit of fun too.</p>
<p>To Aaron: I hope you don’t give up. Try, try, and try again. You’ll get
it eventually. Almost every successful entrepreneur has failed at least
once. Welcome to the world of entrepreneurship, I hope you enjoy the
ride.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
