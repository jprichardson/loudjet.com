Leverage Simplicity and the Desire For Information
==================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5wv42oLzj1qzbc4f.jpg)

From time to time, my mom will clip a newspaper article or send me an
email some info of technology that she finds interesting. This morning,
I received an email from my mom about the Airport Remote app:

If you are a developer, you’re probably thinking “what’s the big deal?”
If you’re an entrepreneur, you’re probably thinking “meh, Orbitz,
Expedia, Travelocity, Tripit, and a thousands of iPhone apps already
provide me with this information.” If you’re my mom, you’re dazzled.

I started thinking about when I travel and what technology I use to make
my traveling experience better. I typically buy my tickets on Orbitz.
Orbitz sends me text messages about flight times and if there will be
delays. I know that other apps exist that do this very same thing as
well. However, when I’m at the airport, I still find myself stopping to
look at the blue screen. At every single airport I do this despite me
knowing that Orbitz will inform me of any changes.

Why do I do this? It’s the same reason that I tend to check
[Clicky](http://getclicky.com/209072) multiple times a day when I only
use to check Google Analytics once a day. It’s called [insecurity
work](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/21/five-tips-for-making-ideas-happen/).
We as humans are a bit insecure. We need to feel in control. We feel
that we have more control when we have more information. That’s why this
app is successful; because it’s simple and we’re insecure.

So if you can build a product that can leverage people’s insatiable
appetite for information and do so in a simple manner, I would bet that
you’re product will succeed.
