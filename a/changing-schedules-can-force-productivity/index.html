<h1>Changing Schedules Can Force Productivity</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbc38iLWFx1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently I joined a new <a href="http://fitnesslincoln.com/">fitness club</a> (that
makes three that I currently pay for, obsessed? Yes, maybe) that focuses
on on intense fast-pace cardio. The idea is that each workout will
change and thus trick your body from adapting to the workout. My fiance
also attends, but she likes to go in the early mornings. Since I enjoy
going with her, I’m stuck to going in the mornings. On the weeks that I
have my son (I alternate every other week with his mother) we go at 5
AM. The other weeks we go at 6:15 AM. The problem for me is that I
really enjoy staying up late and am definitely not a morning person. I
feel forced to go to bed early - about 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM. I hate going
to bed early and love staying up until the late hours of the night.
Staying up into the wee hours of the night is awesome for productivity;
no phone calls, no text messages, loud neighbors, almost no emails, etc.
But, I do enjoy getting my workout done in the early morning.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, the benefit though is that I’m forced to
keep myself in check and not browse away on stupid sites. I know that I
need to get a to bed at a certain time and so I must spend my time
wisely. Admittedly, I haven’t reaped the benefits yet - it’s only my
second week. We’ll see. But you should consider setting hard limits and
see if you become anymore productive. <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php">Embrace
