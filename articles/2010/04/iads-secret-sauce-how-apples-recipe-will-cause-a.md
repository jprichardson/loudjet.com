iAds Secret Sauce: How Apple's Recipe Will Cause a Paradigm Shift
=================================================================

![Apple's Secret
Sauce](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l17rf9ZevV1qzbc4f.jpg)

We’ve seen this happen before.  A breakthrough platform is released and
a disruption occurs.  Those who were enamored by print ads were blown
away once those pictures started moving on Television.  Then came
internet Banner ads.  As channels of distributed content increased, so
did targeting.  On the flip side, as the number of ads displayed
increased, ad efficacy went down.  This is referred to as [Diminishing
Returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns "Wiki: Dimishing Returns"),
or a saturation effect.  Our behavior has adapted to filter out most ads
to increase our content absorption.  The ad campaigns fought back. Full
screen flash ads popped up demanding our attention.  Content seekers
responded with Pop-up blockers.

The battle of Content Seekers vs. Ad Providers has gone back and forth
with constant escalation.  Like when police started carrying semi-autos
and then criminals responded by toting *armor-piercing* semi-autos.  The
tools on each side have become more and more sophisticated while the
companies selling those tools (or weapons) get wealthier. 

Enter Apple.  Enter the paradigm shift of
[iAds](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=32905 "ZDNet: Apple's iAds..."):
*It’s no longer Content Seekers **vs.** Ad Providers, It’s Content
Seekers **&** Ad Provider (Apple)*.  The Ad is no longer the enemy, it’s
a very, very, well-targeted interaction.  And it’s not the interactivity
and engagement that’s making this possible, it’s the fact that Apple can
target your specific needs.  I know, I know, this is a big claim so
allow me to explain.

**Basic Assumptions about high CTRs\
**

1.  *Relevancy is the main factor*: No matter how interactive and
    emotional an ad is or isn’t, if it is something that I am already
    interested in, I will probably click it.
2.  *Interaction and Emotional engagement are secondary factors*: Both
    are important for creating new customers and bringing customers into
    new markets. 
3.  *Novelty is a tertiary factor*: Novelty is the attributing factor to
    the high CTRs we see when any new platform becomes adopted.  In the
    beginning, internet ads hit CTRs as high as 25% because people
    wanted to see what they were and weren’t used to visually blocking
    them out.  It happened again in the mobile market with some ad
    servers touting ratios as high as 15% when the iPhone hit it’s
    stride.  Humans are curious creatures and novelty will always
    produce results, at first…

Now lets look at some of the more recent mobile numbers.  In 08, mobile
ads were looking at CTRs from [2%-8% compared to .83% for non-mobile
ads](http://greatfinds.icrossing.com/google-acquires-admob/ "Google Acquires AdMob"). 
In 09, the spectrum inverted.  According to a report by
[Chitika](http://chitika.com/), [mobile ads only accounted for .48% CTR
when compared to a steady .83% for
non-mobile](http://chitika.com/research/2009/iphone-mobile-users-worst-ad-targets/ "Chitika: iPhone, Mobile Users Worst Ad Targets"). 
There were some agendas and poorly controlled variables in this test
([Techcrunch
Analysis](Study:%20Mobile%20(And%20Particularly%20iPhone)%20Users%20Not%20Keen%20On%20Clicking%20Ads%20%20Read%20more:%20http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/12/study-smartphone-particularly-iphone-users-less-likely-to-click-on-ads/#ixzz0lftX1yak "Techcrunch: Study: Mobile (And Particularly iPhone) Users Not Keen On Clicking Ads")). 
Nevertheless, when our company,
[reflect7](http://reflect7.com "Reflect7 Homepage Awesomeness"),
researched other companies for our mobile ad campaign, we found that a
2% CTR was extremely good.  We ended up landing around the .45%-.55%
mark.

**So how is Apple going to change all of this?  By turning ads into
something that you want to see and interact with, rather than ignore.**

**![Apple Eats Your Cookies For

**

**Apple eats your cookies for breakfast.**  They don’t need to analyze
your cookies for mobile browsing patterns, because mobile searching is
not what users are doing.  Instead, users are spending an average of [30
mins per day on their
apps](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/live-from-apples-iphone-os-4-event/ "Engadget: Live From Apple's OS 4.0 Event"). 
You can bet your third nipple that Apple has been [gathering that
data](http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/ "Apple's Privacy Policy (Apple ID)")
since day one.  It’s called your Apple ID and they know what you’ve
purchased and when you purchased it. 

Every
app/song/ebook/movie/show/probably-tickets-sooner-than-later/anything
digital is broken down into an iTunes Store category.  With this
information, Apple can configure your mobile purchasing profile with
greater accuracy.  Do you subscribe to Time Magazine on the iPad?  Do
you purchase mostly sports apps?  Let’s get really crazy and
cross-reference all of the meta keywords for each app to find
compliments and/or matches.  Supplement that with User Age, Gender, and
Location and you have one hell of a hyper-targeted iAd.  That’s why it
makes sense for Apple to launch it’s own Ad Platform - because it can
keep your information “private” from other ad companies while still
delivering a “superior user experience.”

This Hyper-Targeting is where the paradigm shift takes place.  No longer
will I scowl when seeing Hotel ads for chains that aren’t in my location
while rocking out to Pandora.  Now, I can see ticket ads for the next
music event.

**Bottom Line: Don’t be fooled.  More ad interaction is great, but more
interaction has been attained in the past when more advanced
technologies were adopted.  The trump card is Apple’s ability to hyper
target their ads to meet your needs. **

Look for the next Secret Sauce installment Saturday when I talk more
about Apple’s ad strategy and how it meshes with html5 and their
competition.**\
