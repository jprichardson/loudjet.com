<h1>Five Products That Would Make My Life Easier</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1mn8fh9By1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I would love to see these products. As an entrepreneur, I’m
always incessantly looking for ways to improve my life. You may be
wondering, why don’t I work on any of these if I agree with the
“<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/rework">scratch your own itch</a>” or
“solve your own problems” mantras. Well, I just might. =)</p>
<p><strong>Audio Book/eBook/Hard Copy Deal</strong>\
I realize that I can have all three now. But publishers should really
create a package deal that has all three products discounted. I love my
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/ipad-smart-monkey">iPad for
reading</a>. It stays
in my car constantly. When I have some dead time in my car or an office,
I pull out my iPad and start reading. I run about three miles daily. I
typically listen to audio books. Sometimes I find myself wanting the
tangible feel of a book. Whether it’s outside in the bright sun, or
laying on a couch. At times, a book just feels natural. Admittedly, this
is probably due to my bias of using books for years; over time I’m sure
this will change. Is anyone at Amazon listening?</p>
<p><strong>Mint For Business</strong>\
I know what you’re thinking, why don’t I just use Mint for my business?
Mint is cute. I can tag and categorize each transaction. That’s it. I
want to easily generate P&amp;L statements. I want total control of my
business finances. I want to see how much I spent on software last year
(I know Mint can do this). The real value lies in the aggregate. How
many other companies with 5 to 15 employees are receiving similar
revenues? How many other companies in the software industry are spending
as much as I am on personnel? The possibilities are endless. Remember,
the value is in the aggregate. Steal this idea. If you can execute like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Patzer">Aaron Patzer</a>, you’ll
probably make a Mint. Sorry for the lame joke.</p>
<p><strong>Project Planning Softwar</strong>e\
Ya, ya… there are <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">a lot</a> of
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project/default.aspx">them</a>
<a href="http://www.scrumd.com/">out</a> <a href="http://agilezen.com/">there</a>. I’ve tried
most of them. In search for the perfect product. None of them fits the
bill. I’m looking for a real simple piece of software for me to be able
to list my projects and then be able to plan my iterations. I’m actually
working on this one. I call it Plansation. Hopefully I can show you a
working build before the end of my life.</p>
<p><strong>An All Knowing/Smart Location Network</strong>\
I want a service where I can find out which restaurant is having deals
around me. Which bar is having happy hour specials. What do my friends
think of this hole-in-the-wall restaurant? How much will it cost to get
my slacks pressed somewhere near my hotel? We have articulated this
vision a bit <a href="http://reflect7.com/vision">here</a>. Guess what? There’s an
<a href="http://siri.com/">app</a> for that. At least one that’s pretty damn close.
Oh ya, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-buys-virtual-personal-assistant-startup-siri/">Apple bought them
yesterday</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Social Network For Entrepreneurs</strong>\
I currently use <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>,
<a href="http://foundersmix.com">FoundersMix</a>,
<a href="http://answers.onstartups.com">Answers.OnStartups</a>, <a href="http://startupnation.com">Startup
Nation</a>, and LinkedIn (although, I think
LinkedIn is a joke). But none of them encourage connecting with other
entrepreneurs. In order to succeed, we need to <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/finest-way-to-succeed">help each
other</a>. We
must share business ideas and strategies. All of the sites listed
fail miserably at this. You had better steal this idea too, because I
will eventually work on this as well.</p>
