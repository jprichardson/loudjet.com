Winning Isn't Everything, It's the Only Thing
=============================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5fh6dlSER1qzbc4f.jpg)

[Vince Lombardi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi) once
[said](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQAyMgVoARQ&feature=related):

> Winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing. Either you’re first or
> you’re last.

What does that mean for us? Does it matter if you build a great product?
Of course it does. Does it matter if you improve the lives of your
customers? Of course. So what the hell is my point?

1.  Dan Gilbert is a douchebag. More about that in a minute.
2.  You must have a winner’s mentality.
3.  Profit matters.

**Dan Gilbert Is a Douchebag**\
Many of you have probably heard about [Lebron
James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James) and his decision to
play for the Miami Heat. If you didn’t know, Dan Gilbert is the owner of
the Cleveland Cavaliers - the team Lebron James use to play for. Dan
Gilbert [called Lebron a coward, selfish, callous, and
heartless](http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/gilbert_letter_100708.html)
despite the fact that Lebron was out of contract. The point is that
Lebron understands winning. He wants to win a championship badly, so he
left after his contract expired. He didn’t do anything unethical. Who
can blame the guy?

**Winner’s Mentality**\
You must possess a winner’s mentality. This means that you want to tear
the faces off of your competition in a [Gary
Vaynerchuk](http://twitter.com/garyvee/status/10706011672) sort of way.
This doesn’t mean that you should copy your competition. [DON’T DO
THIS](http://loudjet.com/a/rework). To quote Jason Fried:
“No one will ‘out’ Apple Apple” That is to say, no one will ‘do’ Apple
better than Apple. The winner’s mentality is all about believing that
you are better, and then to actually be better.

**Profit Matters**\
You have \$100 million in revenue? That’s cute. Oh, what’s that?? You’re
spending \$500 million? The only thing that’s worse than no profit, is
to lose money. OK, so I admit that kind of revenue is impressive,
perhaps that jealousy was me really being upset over… uhhhh… nevermind.
To have a real business and to win, you must be making money.

**To Summarize:**\
Your Business Winning = Dan Gilbert’s Douchebaggery + Winner’s Mentality
+ Profit

Since it’s a truth that [Dan Gilbert is a
douchebag](http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/09/techcrunch-comic-sans/),
part of the battle has already been won for you. Now you just have to do
the hard parts.

What do you think about winning?
