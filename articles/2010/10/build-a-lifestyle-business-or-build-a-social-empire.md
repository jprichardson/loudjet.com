Build a Lifestyle Business or Build a Social Empire?
====================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lakpjw9EVH1qzbc4f.jpg)

One constant debate that Reflect7 keeps having internally is do we
refocus and start trying to build web apps a la 37 Signals? Or, do we
incorporate social mechanics into our football apps and try to build a
sports social network? We don’t know.

What we think we know:

-   We aren’t going to just ditch our apps like we previously
    considered. They make enough money for us to keep going. Plus,
    ditching thousands of customers is a dick move without notifying
    them up front.
-   We think that it would be harder to build a grandiose social network
    that is successful.
-   A large social network may require some VC or Angel money. In the
    long run, we are not opposed to either, but we do feel that it’s
    necessary to bootstrap to get there.
-   We don’t like the idea of building a business on B2C, we would
    prefer B2B.

What I think that I know:

-   We’ll have a better shot at being successful by building a lifestyle
    business.
-   My goal is financial freedom. Mainly for the sake of my family’s
    health. They’re all that I deeply am concerned about, and if one of
    them were to get sick, I want to make sure that they’re taken care
    of. A lifestyle business may achieve that quicker.
-   A lifestyle business sounds more boring and feels safer. Neither of
    those are necessary negative.
-   I want to change the world. I want to have an impact. I want to
    change lives like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.
-   I feel that being in downtown Lincoln, NE on Husker game days that
    something is missing… that it’s possible to build something that no
    one has built before that could revolutionize the way fans connect
    with each other and interact with sports.
-   We have established sports apps. Leveraging our current customer
    base into a social network may help our social network gain traction
    quicker.

Corey came up with a pretty good idea on a potential social network.
However, we’re far away from implementation and we’re not sure if we’ll
chase the idea.

I’ll know if I was wrong in three years. One thing is for sure, one of
my mantras is to live life without regrets.

What are your thoughts?
