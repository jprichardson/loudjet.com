Customers Demand Native for Mobile Apps
=======================================

… they may just not know it.

Consider the computing and user interface paradigm on the modern
desktop. Stop for a moment and visualize OS X and Windows. Visualize
yourself using some of your favorite apps on each desktop. You have
buttons, lists, scrollbars, text inputs, datagrids, trees, etc. You have
a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This user-to-device paradigm is very
similar on each platform. To the zealots of UX design, I realize that in
each platform has different human interface guidelines, but the
computing paradigm is still almost the same.

Mobile is different.

Some smart phones have a keyboard. Some a stylus. The ones that most
care about: Android and iOS use touch. But even the Android and iOS
interface paradigms are different. Let’s just start with the device
buttons excluding the keyboard on some Android phones. Android phones
have four buttons. Home, back, menu, search. Press the “back” button to
go back to a previous view on an app. Press the “menu” to access options
of the app. The rest are self explanatory. The iPhone has only one
button: home.

Let’s consider the UI elements available to developers. A lot of
components have the same corresponding component on the other platform:
buttons, text fields, webviews, labels. But the similarities end there.
Grouping of elements, list views, app navigation, are all different. The
user-to-device interface for each platform is different and thus the
user experience is different. Navigating an Android application is
different than navigating an iPhone application. Scrolling is different.
Users expect different behaviors and responses on each platform.

Consider using a mobile web app. The behavior is different than a native
app. You typically have to wait longer for it load, which gives the
impression of sluggishness. The UI elements behave like actual web
pages, despite the fact that some of the frameworks have gotten pretty
good ([Sench Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/), [jQuery
Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [Dragdealer](http://code.ovidiu.ch/dragdealer/)).
But we’re not there yet.

Native apps also offer the goodies of being able to integrate with the
OS (options on iPhone), access native hardware (GPS/Accelerometer), run
background process. Best of all: most can be used in some fashion when
internet access is not available.

Earlier this week, 37signals
[announced](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2761-launch-basecamp-mobile)
there mobile Basecamp app. Except that it’s not a native app, it’s a
mobile web app. Skim the
[comments](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2761-launch-basecamp-mobile?#comments).
Some people are upset that it isn’t a native app.

Sean is right. Client access is becoming distributed. I appreciate
products that work *well* on all of my devices and the user experience
is not just an afterthought.

My main point is this: if you’re a business who needs to reach your
customers on these devices, do not tell yourself or your customers t[hat
you don’t have the time. Be honest that it’s not a
priority.](http://techneur.com/post/535211849/dont-have-the-time) Don’t
short-change your customers, they deserve better, they deserve native.

I should also note that I think this app store/native craziness is only
temporary. I do believe that after HTML5 really standardizes, we’ll see
more acceptable web apps. I don’t see that happening for 5 years or so.

What are your thoughts? Do you think that mobile web apps are good
enough? Do you think that native is better? Do you think that
cross-platform mobile libraries like
[Phonegap](http://www.phonegap.com/),
[Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/),
[Rhomobile](http://rhomobile.com/) are better alternatives?
