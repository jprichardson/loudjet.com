Curly's Law
===========

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7oj5uvbcp1qzbc4f.jpg)

I was an ardent reader of the blog [Coding
Horror](http://codinghorror.com) by Jeff Atwood (StackOverflow fame).
It’s too bad he doesn’t blog much anymore. But Jeff has left me with a
colossal mountain of information on software development.

One of my favorite posts is on [Curly’s
Law](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/curlys-law-do-one-thing.html).
Curly Washburn was a cowboy in the movie City Slickers. Jeff quoted some
dialog from the movie:

> Curly: Do you know what the secret of life is?\
> Curly: This. [holds up one finger]\
> Mitch: Your finger?\
> Curly: One thing. Just one thing. You stick to that and the rest don’t
>  mean shit.\
> Mitch: But what is the “one thing?”\
> Curly: [smiles] That’s what you have to find out.

Jeff relates this to software. But I think the concept equally applies
to a startup. Lack of focus can kill your startup. That’s why it’s so
important to not overload your plate with a number of projects.

Reflect7 has done this. We loaded up consulting projects and tried to
simultaneously build multiple products - all with three guys working
part time. Big mistake. It’s [nearly killed
us](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/curlys-law-do-one-thing.html).

I think that’s what Curly is really talking about. Do one thing, and do
it well - and your customers will love you for it. You just have to
discover what that one thing is.
