Social Media Is Not About You, It's About Everyone But You
==========================================================

I have heard a lot of questions on how one can promote their business.
Invariably, the answer always comes up: “sign up for Facebook and
Twitter!” So, these business owners typically do. They then broadcast
their wares and wonder why they aren’t selling more, don’t have more
followers, or it seems that people are uninterested. They’re doing it
wrong. We’ve all seen [thousands](http://twitter.com/TheAlley) of
[local](http://twitter.com/search/users?q=union+bank&category=people&source=find_on_twitter)
[businesses](http://twitter.com/red9live) do it.

Social media is not about you. It’s about others. It’s about your
customers. It’s about everyone but you. Why not actually have a dialogue
with your customers, fans, friends, followers? Stop thinking of social
media as a one-way broadcast medium. Start thinking of it as a way to
inject yourself into conversations, monitor your brand, and to actually
care about your customers. Give back. Share. Most importantly, care.

I think [Gary
Vaynerchuk’s](http://loudjet.com/a/entrepreneurial-heroes)
advice on promoting your business really works. Find sites/communities
that are in your same industry and inject yourself into conversations.
Share your knowledge. Give as much as you can. Care. You may eventually
establish yourself as an industry leader. This is exactly what he did to
promote [Wine Library TV](http://winelibrarytv.com/). In the meantime,
people will take interest in what you do and may eventually check out
your site or products.

How do you use social media for your business?
