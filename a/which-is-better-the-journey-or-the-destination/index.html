<h1>Which Is Better: the Journey or the Destination?</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l65fb3LIop1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m struggling. I’m struggling with the journey. My feeling probably
resembles that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sparrow">Captain Jack
Sparrow’s</a> feeling of when he
didn’t have a boat - he was looking for a boat to commandeer. I’m
looking for my boat. I’m struggling to balance all of my projects, being
a great father, a great fiance, a great friend, and a great business
partner. I’m struggling to identify my purpose.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. Life is amazing. I’m fortunate enough to have a
healthy nine-year old son, a loving fiance, business partners who happen
to be some of my best friends, an awesome day job, and a business that
is generating some revenue. What more could a man ask for? I think that
I would like are two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A more narrowed focus. I feel too scatter brained with every project
that is on my plate.</li>
<li>Purpose. Ever since I was a child, I got immense joy out of helping
others. The more lives that I can improve, the more fulfilled that I
feel. I’ve learned this in my software projects. If a lot of people
use my software and it improves their lives, then I feel wonderful.
If it’s just software that a few people benefit from, I don’t feel
as good as I think that I could. So then the question becomes: what
is the software or technology that you can build to improve people’s
lives?</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s been said that it’s not about the destination, but it’s about the
journey. One thing is true, I feel like I’m living and loving life to
the fullest. When I arrive at the destination, I will have the answer;
but until then, I will continue to document my journey on this blog.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Any wisdom to share?</p>
