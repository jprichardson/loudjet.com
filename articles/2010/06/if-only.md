If Only
=======

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l46x8kbYiF1qzbc4f.jpg)

If only you had more time.\
If only you were self-employed you wouldn’t have a boss telling you what
to do.\
If only you didn’t have to work two jobs, you would be able to spend
time with your kids.\
If only you were a millionaire you would be able to change the world.\
If only you could hire someone, you would be able to expand quicker.\
If only it weren’t the winter time, you could start running outside.

“If only” is a road block to what you want to accomplish but lack the
will power and desire to do now. Next time you catch yourself saying “if
only”, think about the excuse you’re about to make. Then find the
willpower to commit now.

You can do it, **if only** you start now.
