<h1>Project Managers are from Imaginationland</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l41rcpmbk91qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Project Managers Disrupt</strong></p>
<p>Project Managers that are solely Project Managers are useless. It’s a
make-believe job to make somebody feel important and make the project
seem like it’s, um, being managed.</p>
<p>Like Unicorns that shit skittles, Project Managers shit tasks. Project
Managers have a phantom value to fill. If they’re not “managing stuff”
then they’re not fulfilling their supposed work value. Since “managing
stuff” includes interacting with the team, expect to be bothered with
persnickety details, deadlines, and daily meetings.</p>
<p>The term “Project Manager” presupposes that the team members are unable
to manage themselves. That’s blasphemy. Take a hint from
<a href="http://37signals.com/svn" title="37signals blog">37Signals</a> and hire a
manager of one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’re hiring, seek out people who are managers of one.</p>
<p>What’s that mean? A manager of one is someone who comes up with their
own goals and executes them. They don’t need heavy direction. They
don’t need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do — set the
tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc. — but they
do it by themselves and for themselves.</p>
<p>These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction.
When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they’ve
gotten done. They don’t need a lot of handholding or supervision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A group of self-sufficient employees working with a good piece of
project management software are perfectly capable of handling a project.
Why add a middleman when you can communicate through software that is
designed specifically for this? We use
<a href="http://www.goplanapp.com" title="goplanapp.com">goplanapp</a> and I love it.</p>
<p>If you absolutely need to assign the job to one person, then assign it
to one of the team members. This way, they’ll still be productive when
they’re not managing and won’t feel the need to disrupt others. They
will also have the expertise to understand the core issues that other
team members are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Project Managers Don’t Know The What</strong></p>
<p>Managers need to have general knowledge of every expertise they are
managing. If they don’t, they’ll just end up causing problems.</p>
<p>Case in point. A few months ago, I started a website for a local
company. I estimated my end of the project at 20-30 hours. It took over
40. What happened? Inefficient communication. The project manager only
had management experience. She had no IT experience, no graphics
experience, no design experience, and no programming experience. She
knew how to communicate, but she didn’t know what. Let me rephrase, she
regurgitated the “what” without knowing the “why”.</p>
<p>In
<a href="http://techneur.com/post/550060849/rework" title="JP&#39;s Rework Review">Rework</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried" title="Follow Jason Fried on Twitter">Jason
Fried</a>
and <a href="http://twitter.com/dhh" title="Follow DHH on Twitter">D.H.H</a> argue that
you should do the job yourself before you hire. By doing so, you will
gain an inside perspective on what the job requires and what to hire
for. The same holds true for managers.</p>
<p>Project managers that don’t have a firm grasp on their moving parts
cause tension that will eventually break the machine. They don’t
understand that new technology can cause a whole new can of worms. That
adding a feature may cause more friction for the user. When they want a
redesign, they expect it in two days instead of two weeks. They don’t
get that <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1805-lets-just-call-plans-what-they-are-guesses" title="37Signals Blog: Planning is Guessing">planning is just
guessing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Project Managers Don’t Understand The Why</strong></p>
<p>Project Managers cause people to feel anxious because they don’t have
enough expertise to understand the process. They can’t empathize, and
when they do, it’s inauthentic and alienates the team member. I give
credit to project managers who are trying to learn. Businesses are
always in flux and sometimes someone has to step up. Seasoned managers
that aren’t learning have no excuse for folly. They waste time with
their training wheels. They should learn to ride before leading the
race.</p>
<p><a href="http://Twitter.com/ZAPPOS" title="Follow Zappos on Twitter">Tony Hsieh</a>, CEO
of <a href="http://www.zappos.com" title="zappos.com">Zappos</a>, requires every new hire
to go through at least one month of Customer Service at the call center.
He does this because he knows that those representatives are on the
front lines. They have their ears to the ground and they’ll hear the
rumbles of a stampede before anyone else. After one month of answering
phone calls, the new employees will understand the Whys of the business.</p>
<p><strong>Project Managers Are A Crutch</strong></p>
<p>A good manager sets up a framework, makes it easy for team members to
communicate, and then gets out of the way. Phil Jackson has been doing
this for years. I used to watch the Lakers get pummeled and wondered why
he wouldn’t call a timeout. Why was he letting the other team go on a
12-0 run? Because he was creating a self-sufficient Lakers team. When a
coach keeps calling timeout, the team never learns how to adapt.
Suddenly, the coach’s management style has become a crutch. A team that
can call an internal “Time-out” on the court has learned to adapt in
situations when there are no timeouts left. They no longer need the
coach to hold their hands.</p>
<p>So when it comes to managing, take heed of 37Signals, Tony Hseih, and
Phil Jackson. Let the players play.</p>
