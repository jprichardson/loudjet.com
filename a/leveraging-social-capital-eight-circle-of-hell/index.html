<h1>Leveraging Social Capital and the 8th Circle of Hell</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5jzreATVb1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This weekend I was filling my car up with gas, as I was standing at the
pump, a clean cut man approaches me. He said “do you drink energy
drinks?” I thought that either he was admiring my muscular physique from
a distance or he thought that I looked like the energy
drinking douchebag type. As an aside, I do drink energy drinks and I’m
not really that muscular, and come to think of it… I’m not even sure
that energy drinks have anything to do with a muscular physique… but, I
digress. I said to him “do you prefer sugar-free or not?” He went on to
say that he wasn’t asking for himself. He introduced himself as “Joe”
and that he is working with an energy drink company that was trying to
establish a presence locally. I typically enthusiastically engage in
conversation when salesman or strangers approach me because I’m secretly
hoping I can pimp my iPhone wares to them or even my consulting
services. We spoke a bit about <a href="http://reflect7.com">what I do</a> and then
Joe offered me a sample of his energy drinks. Being the type that
accepts candy from strangers, I gladly obliged. Joe said he would call
me in a few days to ask me about my overall opinion of it. My fiance was
waiting in the car, she said “what was that all about?” I told her that
Joe was trying to break into the local market with his energy drinks. I
told her that I admired Joe’s balls (not literally) for coming up to a
random stranger. I then said that “only MLMers (people who are into
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing">MLM</a>) usually
approach me randomly.” “Maybe Joe is an MLMer” she said. “No, not
clean-cut Joe… Joe just wanted my energy drinking expertise” I thought
to myself.</p>
<p>Allow me to present a diagram to you:\
 <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5jz9nGNxY1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On Monday Joe called me. The dialogue was something like this:\
“So JP, what did you think of the drink?”\
“Meh, it wasn’t too bad, wasn’t great though.”\
“Hahha, well, we have a lot of flavors, so I’m betting that we can find
one that you’ll like.”\
“Ya know Joe, I was thinking… I think it might taste great with Vodka.”\
“Hahhahha… that’s funny.” (I was being serious)\
“JP, did it cause you to crash at all?”\
“No, not it all.”\
“JP, I got to talking with my wife and I really enjoyed our
conversation.” (Here it comes)\
“JP, I’m working with good people like yourself (see what he just did
here?) in the area to expand our operations. Do you have any interest in
this?”\
“Ummm… It’s not clear to me what you’re suggesting.”\
“JP, have you considered alternative income streams?”\
“Absolutely, I would love to expand my business and my consulting. If
these alternative income streams were related to this and and my area of
expertise, then no doubt that I would be interested.”\
“Oh, well, it’s not related to that… but thanks for your time. I’ll text
you my contact info.”\
“Sure, Joe… thanks for the drink”</p>
<p>He then sent a SMS with his website. It redirected to an Amway page.
*Sigh* I was naive.</p>
<p>Why am I huffy-puffy over this? I’m really not. But, I want to point out
that most of these businesses suck for long-term growth.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Level Marketing</strong>\
Some of these can be legit. I have some friends that are <a href="http://pureromance.com/">Pure
Romance</a> consultants. People call them for
parties, and rarely do I hear them trying to push their wares upon their
friends. They are having fun and building a business. The same goes for
<a href="http://www.scentsy.net/en-us/index.aspx">Scentsy</a>, <a href="http://www.tastefullysimple.com/Cultures/en-US/">Tastefully
Simple</a>, and <a href="http://www.pamperedchef.com/">Pampered
Chef</a>. But, by definition these are all
MLM businesses. They rely on you eventually recruiting others and then
that’s when you really start to make money. But you can still make money
by selling the products and by having the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Business that Leverage <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/12/19/personal-finance-101-what-is-social-capital/">Social
Capital</a></strong>\
One can make the argument that all businesses are like this. That’s true
to an extent. But, I’m mainly talking about those salesmen or businesses
that use their friends to get referrals. I had a buddy who I hadn’t
spoke to in awhile tell me that he signed up to be a Farmer’s Mutual
insurance agent. He then wrote that he wanted to get together and
evaluate my financial needs. I flat-out told him that I don’t mix
finances and friendship. Fortunately, he completely understood. Another
insurance guy asked for phone numbers of my friends and he said that he
would call them and say “JP and I are friends and JP thought you might
need some financial assistance.”… I told this dude flat out that we
aren’t friends and that it was pretty audacious for him to assume so.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circles_of_hell">8th-Circle of Hell</a></strong>\
This includes Joe. This includes the Dot-com Franchising douchebags.
Amway. Quixstar. The guys that claim that you can make so much money by
doing so little work. The guys who pass around wads of 100 dollar bills
at their meetings. Yes, they actually do this, presumably to blind the
attendees with greed. The guys that are really nebulous on their
business models, but if you just buy their \$250 kit, you can get
started and you’ll be commandeering your own yacht in two months. These
are businesses owners who prey upon others to get them to sign-up for
their programs to become their own business owners, but the real
business model is in purchasing of the startup kits. This is
<a href="http://www.eiro.com/">Eiro</a>; Eiro will try to blind you with greed,
visit their home page and see for yourself. Many of these people don’t
even know that they’re in the 8th-Circle of Hell, I don’t think Joe
does. I don’t think any of my old acquaintances who dropped out of
college to do Quixstar programs knew either.</p>
<p><strong>I’m Almost Done</strong>\
Tread carefully with any of these businesses. Be aware that leveraging
your social capital can have long-term disastrous affects. People will
avoid you. Make sure that you’re not in the 8th-Circle of Hell… how will
you know? If you you can only really make money by signing people up to
be “under you”… then you are probably in the 8th Circle of Hell.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s important to consider your relationships and the
implications of trying to capitalize upon them. This goes for any
business. If you make websites, I think it’s a bit tacky to try to
inject that in your personal conversations. But, sometimes, someone may
remember this, and then ask you for a website. Remember, relationships
matter most. Don’t jeopardize them for business.</p>
