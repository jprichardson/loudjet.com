<h1>Consider Customer Motivations</h1>

<p>Simon Sinek’s idea of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842808?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techneur-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591842808">Start with the
Why</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=techneur-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1591842808" alt="">”
is something that you must consider about your customers. Watch this TED
video:</p>
<p>The Huffington Post does a wonderful job <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-sinek/when-a-movement-moves_b_669158.html">describing Simon Sinek’s idea
on why so many people showed up to watch Martin Luther King’s famous “I
have a dream.”
speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details of how to achieve civil rights or what needed to be done
were debatable, and different groups tried different strategies.
Violence was employed by some, appeasement by others. Regardless of
how or what was being done, there was one thing everyone had in
common—WHY they were doing it. It was not just Martin Luther King’s
unflappable conviction that was able to stir a population, but his
ability to put his WHY into words. Dr. King had a gift. He talked
about what he believed. And his words had the power to inspire:</p>
<p>“I believe.”</p>
<p>“I believe.”</p>
<p>“I believe.”</p>
<p>People heard his beliefs and his words touched them deep inside. Those
who believed what he believed took that cause and made it their own.
And they told people what they believed. And those people told others
what they believed. Some organized to get that belief out more
efficiently.</p>
<p>And in the summer of 1963, a quarter of a million people showed up to
hear Dr. King deliver his “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p><strong><em>But how many people showed up for Dr. King?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Zero.</em></strong></p>
<p>They showed up for themselves. It was what they believed. It was what
they saw as an opportunity to help America become a better version of
itself. It was they who wanted to live in a country that reflected
their own values and beliefs that inspired them to get on a bus to
travel for eight hours to stand in the Washington sun in the middle of
August to hear Dr. King speak. Being in Washington was simply one of
the things they did to prove what they believed. <strong><em>S*</em></strong>howing up
that day was one of the WHATs to their own WHY.<em>*</em> This was a cause
and it was their cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Emphasis mine]</p>
<p>Zero people showed up for Martin Luther King. It was for themselves, it
was for the shared belief, the shared dream. It made them feel good.</p>
<p>When discussing <a href="http://techneur.com/post/1406631916/announcing-tribal-fan">Tribal
Fan</a> the
other night, we assembled a list of things that fans do to show their
passion and love for their teams.</p>
<p>They…</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to games.</li>
<li>Tailgate.</li>
<li>Comment on blog posts.</li>
<li>Buy apparel and memorabilia.</li>
<li>Read sporting news.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, they don’t do this for the team. These fans have much in common
with those who showed up to watch MLK’s speech. They do this for
themselves. They do it to prove how much of a fan they are.</p>
<p>Before building a product or <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/02/are-you-building-an-empire-sparking-a-powder-keg-or-starting-a-movement.html">starting a
movement</a>,
you must consider your WHY and your customers’ WHY.</p>
