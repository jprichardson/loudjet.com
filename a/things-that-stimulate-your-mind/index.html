<h1>Things that Stimulate Your Mind</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbob23ZDyv1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the spring and summer, I don’t listen to the radio in my car; this is
because I hate listening to ads. They steal my thoughts, so my car rides
consist of plain silence. However, when football season starts, I turn
the AM sports’ stations on. My mind then consumes all football related
information. I like it. But I don’t love it, because I still have to
deal with ads. I’ve noticed within the last month that I haven’t blogged
as much. Before, I was blogging every weekday. It was tough at times,
but it felt like an accomplishment. Maybe it’s because most of my
time concocting blogging posts was developed while driving?</p>
<p>A lot of my friends and family watch TV. At social gatherings a
conversation always comes up about various TV shows… Glee, How I Met
Your Mother, Southpark, etc. Then when asked about my TV preferences, I
always respond that I don’t watch TV unless it’s football. I don’t watch
TV because it’s mindless. I rarely walk away from a TV show that has in
some profound way encouraged me to challenge my thoughts or opinions. TV
is a waste of time, plain and simple. Ahhh, but some might consider me a
hypocrite. Because I do like movies. I like movies for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a beginning and an end. Usually, movies last anywhere from
90 to 120 minutes. TV shows try to hook you for the entire season.
In the past, when I would watch a few episodes of a series or some
show, I’d feel the need to go back and watch all of the previous
ones and tune in to upcoming shows. When a movie is over, I can
resume what I was doing without planning for the next week to watch
it again.</li>
<li>There are a lot of movies that make me ‘think.’ They challenge my
beliefs and encourage me to not accept the status quo. V for
Vendetta and Inception are great examples of this.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have free time, I would encourage you to ask yourself if the
activity that you’re about to do (I’m not referring to physical
activity) will stimulate your mind? Or is it a mindless waste of time?</p>
<p>Two favorite sites of mine that stimulate my mind and make me think:
<a href="http://mnmlist.com/">mnmlist</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
News</a>.</p>
<p>What stimulates your mind?</p>
