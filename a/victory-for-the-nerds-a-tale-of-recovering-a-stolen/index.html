<h1>Victory for the Nerds: A Tale of Recovering a Stolen Laptop</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo8n8d5Z5C1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Brace yourself, this is a long one. Scroll to the end for the TL;DR.</p>
<h2>Before</h2>
<p>My wife and I got back home from our honeymoon on Monday morning (July
4th) at about 3:30 AM. We went to our bedroom and immediately hit the
pillows. Slumber never felt so good. I awoke at around 12:30 PM, anxious
to get to the gym, as I had been eating grease and alcohol for over a
week straight. My body was begging me for activity.</p>
<p>When I go to the gym I bring my iPad so that I can easily read books and
run on the treadmill. (As an aside, the soaking of knowledge via a book
and the sweat caused from running is like an injection of heroin for the
day. Try it.) I looked around the house for my iPad, which is typically
in my laptop bag. My laptop bag wasn’t anywhere. Mind you, our house
looked like a tornado came through and decided to drop off a bunch of
wedding gifts, clothes, and misc. crap from my old house (I had just
moved in right before we left for the honeymoon). I figured that the bag
was around the house somewhere. Right before we left, I also noticed
that two other laptops were missing from our computer room. “No big
deal.” I thought, surely they’re around here somewhere.</p>
<p>As my wife and I were traveling to the gym, I started to entertain the
fact that maybe they could have been stolen. I still wasn’t convinced
though, as we still had our flatscreen TVs, my wife’s laptop, an older
Dell laptop, our bikes and other misc. valuables. Surely the thieves
would have taken everything valuable? I couldn’t workout at the gym; you
see, my MacBook Pro is like my baby. It felt as if I should notify an
Amber Alert for my silver aluminum child.</p>
<p>As we were driving home, I recalled reading internet stories of nerd
vigilantes hunting down the culprits of their stolen goods. I briefly
fantasized about such a scenario. I remember reading that it’s common
for thieves to put stolen wares on eBay or Craigslist. What could it
hurt to search?</p>
<h2>Craigslist</h2>
<p>I walked into the door and grabbed my wife’s laptop and fired up the
browser to Craigslist. I started browsing the For Sale section on
computers. I quickly stumbled into some MacBook Pros. My MacBook Pro was
the late 2008 model (pre-unibody). I found an ad!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macbook pro \$775… need the money. Willing to trade for…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I swiftly called.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you have that, uhhh… Apple laptop for sale still?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you want to look at it?”</p>
<p>“You bet. Where at?”</p>
<p>“Just come to my house… my address is ########”</p>
<p>“OK, I can be there in about 45 mins or so. See ya.” (At this time
it’s about 4:00 PM or so)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person sounded like a teenage kid. A kid that talked like he had a
bit of exposure to the inner city. This is Lincoln, Nebraska.
Population: 275k. There isn’t much of an “inner-city” here. Even the
closest big city, Omaha (pop 500k) doesn’t have much of an “inner-city.”
But I remember at that age, acting a bit “gangsta.” Maybe that’s what he
was doing.</p>
<p>I scrolled even lower to older laptops on Craigslist. I found another
that looks like my model MBP!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“macbook 15” \$850… willing to trade, need to pay off my car!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was weird that this listing used the same red backdrop for the laptop
as the other listing but the phone number was different. I called. No
answer. Not even a voicemail recording that says “this is so-and-so,
please leave a message…”. Odd.</p>
<p>The phone then rang. It was the person that I just called.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yo, you just call me?”</p>
<p>“Uhhh… yeah, um, do you have an Apple laptop for sale? Wait, did I
just talk to you?”</p>
<p>“Naaah man, I didn’t talk to you. But yeeuuuh, I got da laptop.”</p>
<p>“Can I see it to check out how it works and the condition?”</p>
<p>“Meet me at Best Buy at like 5:30”</p>
<p>“Cool, I’ll see you then.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This person had the same sort of speaking style as the first person.
This is a bit weird, I thought.</p>
<p>I jumped into the shower and planned how this might all work. I’d go to
the first guy’s house around 4:45 PM and then go to Best Buy at 5:30 PM.
“Perfect”, I thought. I’d be home just in time for dinner. (Douche bag
alert ;p) I got out of the shower and instead of putting on my sandals
and shorts, I put on sneakers and jeans. I’m 6’1” about 235 lbs. I’m
fairly built. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t consider myself to be some
tough bad ass or anything like that. I’d just thought that I was going
into someone’s house alone that I didn’t know. This person may have my
stolen property; I wasn’t sure how I’d react. Would I grab my laptop and
run? Would I get angry and call the police right there? Would he and his
friends be there? Would they  threaten me? I felt that if for some
reason I wore sneakers and jeans, I’d be me more prepared to fight or
defend myself if needed to.</p>
<p>I walked downstairs telling my wife my plan on visiting the kid’s house
and then Best Buy and my anticipated return time. She told me that I got
a text. It was the guy that I was going to meet at Best Buy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“U gonna pay full price for the laptop”</p>
<p>“Ya, that might work if it’s in good condition.”</p>
<p>“K, cuz u said u talked to me alrdy so I didn’t want the price to
get messed up”</p>
<p>“Oh, haha. I’ve been looking at a few others so I got confused.”</p>
<p>“Lol. I fell yeah. its in good condition. The only prob is that it has
a black scuff in the right corner”</p>
<p>“K, that shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>“K c ya”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My laptop had a black scuff in the righthand bottom corner! I knew this
was my laptop. At this time my wife was pleading for me to call the
police. I hadn’t had a police report filed yet. I’m a libertarian, so
fundamentally, I like to rely upon myself to solve problems and
accomplish things. Calling the police felt premature. “Honey, you know
my beliefs and how I feel towards these things.” I retorted. “But, it’s
OK to ask for help when you need it.” my wife incessantly pleaded. “When
the time is right.”</p>
<p>I left and got in the car to drive the kids house. As I was driving I
started thinking that it seemed pointless to go to the kids house since
I was sure he didn’t have my laptop. I was also starting to think that I
shouldn’t go to Best Buy alone.</p>
<h2>Meeting at Best Buy</h2>
<p>I called my business partner and friend,
<a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Corey</a>, and asked him to tag along. Corey
is always up for an adventure.</p>
<p>I arrived at his house. We quickly schemed up a plan. We both knew that
if we could verify that it was my laptop we had to have the police come
immediately, as the guy could ditch the laptop somewhere and it’d be
tough to prove that he was in possession of stolen property.</p>
<p>Our plan was for me to pretend like I was a computer idiot and Corey was
my friend the computer guru that came along to help me. I didn’t think
I’d be alright holding the laptop and then opening up the About window
to verify it was mine. I wasn’t sure if in a fit of panic I’d run with
it or do something else stupid. So, Corey was going to open up the About
window and I’d tell the guy that I needed to go inside Best Buy and get
some cash out of the ATM machine when in reality that’s when I’d call
the police. Our plan felt solid.</p>
<p>My wife texted me the MBP serial number found on the MBP box. Corey and
I memorized it.</p>
<p>Just before we were about to leave I got a call from the kid whose house
I decided not to go to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, you coming over?”</p>
<p>“Shit, sorry, I got stuck doing some stuff. How much longer will you
be there?”</p>
<p>“Not much longer… you can come tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I hung up the phone, about 30 seconds later the guy that I’m
meeting at Best Buy calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You still good to meet at Best Buy at 5:30?”</p>
<p>“Ya man.”</p>
<p>“K, I’ll be there in a bit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Odd that shortly after I talk to the kid, the other guy calls.</p>
<p>Corey lends me one of his goofy hats, ya know like that hat the kid
wears in the movie Sandlot. We thought it’d be a good idea to put on a
hat in event that anyone saw pictures on my hard drive of me. I
considered sunglasses, but that seemed to be an overkill. Corey took the
sunglasses.</p>
<p>We left felt like we were undercover detectives who were about to bring
down and entire crime ring of thievery, drugs, and prostitution.
Adrenaline was pumping.</p>
<p>We got there; I parked in the front. I texted him. (There were some
other texts related to the minutiae of meeting, etc. During these I
realized, that he was texting like a person that would cause grammar and
spelling Nazis to order a holocaust on him and others like him. I’m anal
with grammar and spelling in my texts to strangers. I decided that I
should change my texts to be more like his so that he doesn’t suspect
anything. I know, I know, I deserve the citizen’s badge of honor for
such awesome undercover work.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“U at BB yet?”</p>
<p>“Imma be there in like 5 min”</p>
<p>“K, coo”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The front of my car was facing the building. Many cars were coming and
going. Could he have seen us and decided to not show up? “Corey, turn
around man… let’s not be too obvious.” Corey kept turning his head
around, for some reason, I believed that by him doing that, it’d blow
our cover. Dumb, I know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Im pulling in, where u at?”</p>
<p>“Right front side of bldng”</p>
<p>“Dont see u”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No cars were coming in. Shit, he must have been camped out here. Fuck,
he got scared and left, I thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Still dont see u”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I saw a black Lexus with tinted windows that you couldn’t see
through. The front two windows were rolled down. Corey and were relieved
that he came alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think I see u, were walking to the cntr of the lot”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person parked the car, we were approaching the passenger side. The
driver looked to be Eastern European, maybe 2nd generation, with short
black hair and olive colored skin wearing a white tank top and loose
basketball shorts that were down to his shins. I’d guess he was in his
late teens to early 20’s. As Corey and I approached the car we noticed
that he didn’t come alone. There were two guys in the back seat. One
looked a lot like the first, Eastern European, only younger. The other
looked like a first generation immigrant from Africa. [I hope these
descriptions don’t sounded bigoted, I’m just trying to accurately
describe what we saw.] They were all wearing loose baggy clothes. </p>
<p>We walked around to the driver’s side of the car. The guy got out and
tossed the laptop onto the hood of his car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m Nico. What’s yo name?”</p>
<p>“Jon.” (I go by JP, but for some reason I thought I’d go by Jon at
that moment.)</p>
<p>“Cool. Here’s the laptop.”</p>
<p>(As Corey open’s it up)</p>
<p>“Corey, what do you think? Will this work for me?”</p>
<p>“I think so…” (As he opens up the “About this Mac” screen)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then saw the serial number. It was really my laptop! At this time, I
had no idea how these guys got my laptop. I felt like I was in the
movies… the black Lexus, three thugs, and my stolen property. I was
pissed that they wiped it with a new copy of OS X. (Anyone know of some
good file recovery software for OS X?) I asked a few more stupid
question about OS X to throw him off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So how much do you want for it?”</p>
<p>“I’m asking \$850, but that’s negotiable.”</p>
<p>“Would you take \$700?” (For some reason, I felt that if I told him
I’d give him \$850 that’d seem too weird and maybe he’d suspect
something)</p>
<p>“Would you meet me at \$775?”</p>
<p>“Sure, but I don’t have much cash on me. I need to go inside to the
ATM.”</p>
<p>“How much ya got on you?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I pulled out my wallet and started counting the cash…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ughhh… like \$50.”</p>
<p>“Ohh OK. We’ll just wait.”</p>
<p>“Corey, you just wanna stay out here?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope was that Corey could distract them and keep them occupied so
that they didn’t worry about me taking along time.</p>
<p>I started to walk towards the entrance of Best Buy. “Shit, I forgot to
get the license plate number.” I thought. “It’d be too obvious to turn
around and get it now.” As this internal dialogue about the license
plate was raging on in my head I approached the area with the Mac
laptops. Beads of sweat were forming on my forehead. I was hoping that
if they saw me, I could say I was looking at a few Macs for comparison.
I picked up my iPhone and had the police pre-programmed in so that I
didn’t have to locate the number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lincoln Police service desk” a woman said.</p>
<p>“Hi, uggh, these guys have my stolen property. It’s my laptop. They
have it now at Best Buy! You have to send some officers RIGHT NOW!” I
felt that I needed to sound frantic to make the situation have a sense
of urgency.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you with the guys?”</p>
<p>“They are outside, my friend is out there talking to them. They have
my laptop! I think that maybe I should just grab it or something
because it’s MINE.” At this point, I wasn’t planning on this, but I
really felt the need to make it clear that she should send some
officers immediately.</p>
<p>“Sir, you’ll have to stall them a bit, but I’ve sent two cruisers from
the nearby station.”</p>
<p>“OK, we will be standing by a black Lexus. You can’t miss us. I’m
wearing a hat and my friend is wearing sunglasses. The other guy has
on a white tanktop and two guys are in his backseat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thanked the woman and headed over to the ATM. I wasn’t sure if any of
them came inside and may have watched what I was doing, so I felt the
need to withdraw at least some cash. I withdrew \$200. I could claim
that was the ATM limit and I was thinking that it could potentially give
me an excuse to have to go the bank or something if the police didn’t
show up.</p>
<p>I looked out the window and saw Corey walking away from their car and
Nico was getting into the car. “Fuck, they are leaving!” I hurried out.
Fortunately they saw me and got out of the car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So what’s the deal?”</p>
<p>“Hey uggh sorry. I was looking at other laptops inside. What’s the
processor in this laptop?”</p>
<p>“It’s an i7 man. The best!”</p>
<p>“Corey, can you look at it…”</p>
<p>“It says Core 2 Duo.”</p>
<p>“Ohh sorry, thought it was i7”</p>
<p>“How many processors are in there? Are there 8? Some of those inside
have 8.”  I felt the need to start asking stupid questions to stall.</p>
<p>“Maaannn, those are like \$3000!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about this Apple operating system. I’m a Windows guy.
Will this do my photo editing and allow me to make Powerpoints and
write papers and stuff?”</p>
<p>“Yeah man, I got a disk I can sell you too to make Powerpoints.”</p>
<p>“Cool!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I saw two cruisers pull in the parking lot. The guys were
oblivious. The two in the back seat were busy texting while Nico was
frustrated with my idiocy. I kept pressing with stupid questions.</p>
<p>One cruiser pulls behind his car and another cruiser pulls in front. The
guy was a bit startled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s my laptop” I said.</p>
<p>“No it’s not, I’ve owned this for three years.”</p>
<p>“No I have the serial number to prove it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the officer cuffed the Nico, he proclaimed that he had bought it from
an African girl a week ago. Five more cruisers pulled in and surrounded
the car. The two other guys were cuffed. The look on their face was if
like one of a child who just got caught shoplifting at a grocery
store. The ‘oh shit!’ look on their face was priceless. They knew they
were caught. </p>
<p>Victory for Corey and me.</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>An investigator came over that night. Shortly before he came, we
realized that all of our wedding gift cards were gone and our
PS3/games/controllers. We were convinced that someone knew our garage
code and that’s how they got in. With the investigator we inspected
possible break-in points. When we walked in the backyard and look at the
back of the house it became clear. One of the screens was cut in half
and the window was unlocked.</p>
<p>The next day we were told that the three guys did indeed buy the laptop
from an African girl. I guess they met her on Facebook or something
along those lines. Nico spent the night in jail since he was 19. If you
recall from the beginning of the story how I was going to go to that
kid’s house before I went to Best Buy, well it turns out that kid was
Nico’s brother. [Found out later his name wasn’t Nico] He was sitting in
the back of the car at Best Buy. The officers were able to search the
African girl’s house. They recovered my iPad, PS3, some of the games,
and one other laptop. My netbook is still missing. Unfortunately the
African girl is saying that she broke into my house. She said that she
just walked up to the door and it was unlocked. The police believe that
she’s covering for someone.</p>
<p>Overall though, I’m not pissed anymore. It’s all just material stuff
anyway. I have my health and a great life so I can’t complain too much.
Plus, this will be a story that I’ll tell indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> 3 laptops, iPad, PS3, and wedding gift cards were stolen. I
found my laptop on Craigslist and busted the thugs in the Best Buy
parking lot.</p>
