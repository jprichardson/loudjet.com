Consider Customer Motivations
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgorg3Jiju1qzbc4f.jpg)

Simon Sinek’s idea of “[Start with the
Why](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842808?ie=UTF8&tag=techneur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591842808)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=techneur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1591842808)”
is something that you must consider about your customers. Watch this TED
video:

The Huffington Post does a wonderful job [describing Simon Sinek’s idea
on why so many people showed up to watch Martin Luther King’s famous “I
have a dream.”
speech](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-sinek/when-a-movement-moves_b_669158.html):

> The details of how to achieve civil rights or what needed to be done

> Violence was employed by some, appeasement by others. Regardless of

[Emphasis mine]

Zero people showed up for Martin Luther King. It was for themselves, it
was for the shared belief, the shared dream. It made them feel good.

When discussing [Tribal
Fan](http://loudjet.com/a/announcing-tribal-fan) the
other night, we assembled a list of things that fans do to show their
passion and love for their teams.

They…

1.  Go to games.
2.  Tailgate.
3.  Comment on blog posts.
4.  Buy apparel and memorabilia.
5.  Read sporting news.

But, they don’t do this for the team. These fans have much in common
with those who showed up to watch MLK’s speech. They do this for
themselves. They do it to prove how much of a fan they are.

Before building a product or [starting a
movement](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/02/are-you-building-an-empire-sparking-a-powder-keg-or-starting-a-movement.html),
you must consider your WHY and your customers’ WHY.
