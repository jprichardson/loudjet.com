Dear Apple: Help Us to Build a Successful Business on the App Store
===================================================================

Dear Apple,

As you know, building a successful business requires positive customer
interactions. Like most businesses, we get customer complaints; like any
good business, we want to address each complaint to provide a fix or
compensation for the user’s time spent on the problematic app. We strive
to be like Zappos and we want to deliver the WOW experience.

When a customer emails us about an app that doesn’t work on their phone,
we would like to be able to provide a refund, as any good business
would. On the Android App Store, we’re able to do that. It’s as simple
as clicking the button “Process Refund” for any transaction and
selecting the refund amount. The money is seamlessly transferred back to
the customer. Why can’t we do this on the Apple App Store? When we get
complaints about our iPhone apps, we’ve resorted to sending Amazon Gift
Cards. We don’t send iTunes Gift Cards because we then would have to use
iTunes; iTunes is typically linked to our personal iTunes account. Also,
the minimum iTunes gift card amount is \$15.

I urge you to consider implementing customer management into the Apple
App Store. It may not seem important today, as I suspect many users
don’t mind wasting \$1 - \$3 on a problematic app. But, with your
upcoming Mac App Store, it’ll be imperative to give developers the
ability to refund money to customers. I don’t think many customers will
just shrug off having spent \$30 to \$50 on a Mac App that doesn’t work
on their system.

Kind Regards,

JP
