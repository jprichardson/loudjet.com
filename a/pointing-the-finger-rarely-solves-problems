<h1>Pointing the Finger Rarely Solves Problems</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6muitFxEt1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember the last time you had an argument with a colleague, friend, or
spouse? Did you ever have the urge to start placing the blame on the
other person? Did you actually do it? Did they do it to you? Anytime
you’re in conflict with someone and you start a sentence with “You
did…”, you have fired shots and are about to engage in blood warfare. It
might feel good to let someone know that they messed up or make it clear
to others that someone messed up, but it rarely solves anything. Most of
the time, it’ll only make you feel good for a few seconds until someone
else starts pointing the finger at you.</p>
<p>Remember the old saying “when you point your finger at someone, you have
four pointing back at you?” So when you have the urge to blame someone
else, don’t. When someone else starts blaming you, you can quickly
defuse the situation by admitting your faults and then ask that person
if they want to help you create solutions. Most of the time, it’ll work
and you’ll end up being one step closer to an actual solution.</p>
