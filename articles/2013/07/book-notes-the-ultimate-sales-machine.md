I had always considered myself decent at sales. Nothing spectacular, but knew enough to close some deals.

I picked up Chet Holmes's book [The Ultimate Sales Machine][] and boy was I in for a surprise.


Introduction
------------

He starts the book with an anecdote about a carpet cleaning company that wants to increase their sales. He gives them one tactic. Instead of using product data in the sales process, use market data. i.e. cleaning your carpets has real health benefits. The carpet company was then able to sign up customers to have their carpets cleaned biannually, almost like a doctor's checkup.

Chet goes on to make a case that by reading this book, you'll need to work and apply the principles one hour a week. That it's important to work harder and not smarter and that "pigheaded discipline and determination" are the keys.
