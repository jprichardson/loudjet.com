Discipline Is the Strength to Do Things that Will Make Our Future Selves Proud
==============================================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7sjjfT3cj1qzbc4f.jpg)

I’ve written before how I’ll repeat phrases in my head in an attempt to
motivate myself to success. My first one was: “[How Bad Do You Want
It](http://loudjet.com/a/how-bad-do-you-want-it)?” I
repeated this over and over as I was working on my dual-engineering
degrees. Lately I’ve been repeating “[Embrace
Discomfort](http://loudjet.com/a/embrace-discomfort).” I
do this to force myself into situations where I might be uncomfortable.
I know that if I put myself in an uncomfortable situation and embrace
it, I’ll grow.

My most recent is:

> Discipline is the strength to do the things that will make our future
> selves proud, instead of vaguely ashamed. - coderoom.wordpress.com

This quote came from what I would consider to be one of the [best blogs
posts](http://coderoom.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/discipline-be-the-machine/)
that I’ve read this year. Seriously.

The author writes:

Exactly. Remove the easy option off of the table. Don’t believe that you
can take a short break browsing something and then come back in a few
minutes to work. I’ve been guilty of this so many times. Many times when
I’m waiting for a compile to finish, I’ve been guilty of firing up
Hacker News or some other site thinking that I’ll only be a minute. 45
minutes passes. This has happened way too much. I even built a tool to
measure my [consumption vs
production](http://loudjet.com/a/less-consumption-more-production).
It works.

Read the article. Take the easy option off the table. Don’t take breaks
to read other sites. Be a machine. Build products one by one - and you
will win.

If a Buddhist monk can set himself on fire and be disciplined enough not
to move, you can be disciplined enough to avoid distractions to actually
get work done.
