<h1>A Message to Capital One and Other Companies Who Sell Commodities</h1>

<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>
<p>I recently received a phone call from the Capital One Fraud Department.
Apparently they ‘detected’ fraudulent activity on my account. When the
woman started asking me for my account number or social security number,
I became a bit suspicious. I told her that I would call them back. I
forgot. A few days later, I received another call letting me know that
my current card would be closed and a new one would be sent to me. Still
a bit leery, I called them back using the fraud number I found on their
website. I had to wait on hold for awhile. I thought this was a bit odd
that they would have a high-hold time for their fraud department, as it
really affects their bottom line - I won’t be responsible for any
fraudulent charges, so you would think that they would want to help the
customer ASAP. I
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jprichardson/status/24710714594">tweeted</a> out my
thoughts on this matter and Capital One’s Twitter account responded
immediately. I didn’t notice this until after my phone call.</p>
<p>After waiting for about 5 minutes or so, a man with a foreign accent
answered. As an aside, everyone that I spoke with in the fraud
department had a foreign accent… is this department outsourced? To this
man’s credit, he was friendly. However, it seemed that he couldn’t get
any question answered or make any changes to my account without putting
me on hold multiple times. When he asked about the recent charges on my
account, he seemed very surprised by the fact that they were fraudulent
charges. These two charges were in New York/New Jersey…. I’ve never been
to either. After 30 mins of talking/hold, there was a resolution to send
me a new card and cancel the charges.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, were the charges canceled? No. I was outraged! I don’t
and still don’t understand why it’s so difficult to remove the charges.
So I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jprichardson/status/26105968960">tweeted</a>
out a response to their first
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AskCapitalOne/status/24753559906">response</a> to my
first tweet. I received an email on Sunday notifying me about my
statement balance. I checked the statement, and the charges were still
there. I lost it. I called, and fortunately the woman that I spoke to
was friendly as well. I prefaced our conversation that I was really
upset and that I realized that it wasn’t her fault, but unfortunately as
a representative of the company she needed to listen to my anger. I was
very clear that the last two charges were fraudulent and needed to be
removed. She said that she would instantly remove them and that credit
would show up on my statement. I just checked, and I’ve been credited.
Phew.</p>
<p><strong>What Capital One and Other Companies Who Produce Commodities Should
Change</strong></p>
<p>Let me first state that I believe that my experience with Capital One
reflects a company who is at least trying. Their customer service was
friendly and the fact that they have a Twitter account demonstrates a
willingness to care. However, more must me done.</p>
<p>See, companies who produce commodities (credit card companies are a dime
dozen)… need to go out of their way to create loyalty, as consumers
aren’t loyal to commodities. Customer service is marketing. If I tell
five of my friends that I’ve had problems with Capital One, they are
less likely to choose Capital One. This problem is exacerbated in our
modern social networked world. Now, all it takes is a Facebook status
update or a Tweet for 1000’s of people to know of my subpar experience
with Capital One. If Capital One had a zero wait-time when I called,
cancelled the charges immediately, didn’t keep me on the phone for over
30 mins, and their Twitter users took more initiative, I would be one
satisfied customer. </p>
<p>I know, I know… there is that argument that companies who produce
commodities operate on razor-thin margins. Well, if Zappos can sell
shoes and deliver a great customer service experience, then I’m
convinced most other companies can too. Even Reflect7 is a living model
of this. We get constant complaints, most of the time people receive an
email response right away.</p>
<p>The real lesson here is that industries with so much competition need to
leverage personalization and caring as a reason as to why consumers
should stay with them.</p>
