Positivity Breeds Positivity
============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lev1ilFk5d1qzbc4f.png)

Think for a moment about the people that you like to be around the most.
What characteristics do they have in common? I’ll bet that these people
are generally upbeat, happy, and positive about life. Two of my best
friends are exactly like this. These are the type of guys that rarely
let the small things of life bother them and seem to have an optimistic
view of life. It’s by no coincidence that people gravitate towards them.

Think about how you are. Are you generally optimistic and positive? Or
are you generally negative and pessimistic? Do you like to be around
negative people? We all know of that person who complains all of the
time… they aren’t pleasant to be around.

Next time that you are around a bunch of people and you have a hankering
to say something negative, try to refrain. Instead, keep a smile on your
face, be enthusiastic and optimistic. You’ll soon find that people
gravitate towards you.

Negativity breeds negativity. Positivity breeds positivity.
