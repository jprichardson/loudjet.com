The Startup Idea Filter
=======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6z1oon2sH1qzbc4f.jpg)

Much like an adolescents take years to mature and develop into adults,
startups take years to mature into established companies. I’m finding
that lack of focus may be the \#1 killer of startups. That is to say,
entrepreneurs typically [have idea
A.D.D](http://spencerfry.com/idea-shaping). Idea A.D.D. at many times
has almost killed me, and it has almost
killed [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com).

Monday was the last night of the [Brasch Fast
Start](http://braschfaststart.com). It’s a 12 month program led by John
Brasch to educate entrepreneurs in the community. If you’re a
Lincolnite, you should definitely think about signing up for the next
session. But, I digress. I was at the meeting and the group’s discussion
prompted me to start developing an idea filter to test if a company
should spend time on it or not. Without further ado, they are not
presented in any prioritized order. This Startup Idea Filter is an idea
in and of itself that needs to marinate and be fleshed out.

1.  **Monetization Strategy** - This is critical. If you aren’t making
    money, you don’t have a business. You have a hobby. You don’t have
    to commit to any particular monetization strategy, but you should at
    least think of a few in the event that one of them fails.
2.  **Time to [MVP](http://loudjet.com/a/mvp-galls-law)**
    - How long will it take until you get that MVP built? If it’s longer
    than three months, you may want to consider something else. If your
    initial estimate is three months, you know as well as I do that
    it’ll take at least six. Your estimate should be 1.5 months. The
    goal is that you need to be able to get something up and in front of
    customers ASAP. Even if it sucks.
3.  **Customer Validation** - Steve Blank is a [proponent of this
    one](http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation).
    Find 10 [customers who will pay
    you](http://blog.asmartbear.com/customer-validation.html) for your
    product before you even write a line of code. No, not 10 customers
    who say that they would pay, but say that they will. Of course, they
    might not, but there is a big difference between “would” and “will.”
    “Will” shows commitment.
4.  **Research competition -** Competition validates your market. Don’t
    be afraid of it. If there isn’t competition, your idea might really
    suck.
5.  **Be a Pill** - Not a vitamin. I heard this from one of [Matt
    Mullenweg’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg) keynotes.
    This isn’t a dealbreaker for the idea, but the main point is that
    your idea should solve a clear problem. 

Of course there will be more filters that you can and should apply. In
fact, I’m sure the “Startup Idea Filter” will gain additional points.

I would add that once your idea meets this filter, you should do the
following:

1.  **[Blog About
    It](http://cdixon.org/2010/03/14/developing-new-startup-ideas/) -** Feedback
    can help you refine your thoughts. No one will steal your idea
    because they don’t have your vision and they aren’t you. I should
    also add that if your idea is that copyable, that may be another
    reason that it sucks. Plus, it’ll eventually be copied anyway. But,
    consider that most people who are able to copy your idea most likely
    have ideas of their own. I blogged about
    [MindSpread](http://loudjet.com/a/announcing-mindspread)
    [twice](http://loudjet.com/a/what-would-motivate-you-to-use-mindspread).
    I’ve gotten little feedback despite driving over 500 hits to the
    original announcement. I even have a plea asking for help. Does the
    idea suck? I don’t know… but people’s lack of interest is a bit
    telling.
2.  **Marinate the Idea** - Don’t act on an idea right away. Action on
    passion is poisonous. Ideas need to marinate. Plus blogging your
    idea helps marinate them. Consider other’s feedback as the spices
    and your time away from the idea discussing it with your partners is
    the sauce. If you get continued interest and many people asking you
    about it, you may have an idea ready to bake.

I’ll let the “Startup Idea Filter” marinate for awhile… what do you
think should be added?
