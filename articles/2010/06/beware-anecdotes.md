Beware of the Anecdotes
=======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l43ce0EDJ71qzbc4f.jpg)

Aaron wrote an article titled “[The Myth of the Single Person
Startup](http://www.aaronstannard.com/post/2010/06/12/The-Myth-of-the-Single-Person-Startup.aspx).”
His story is about how he took a month off of work to launch a startup
by himself and then failed. My goal is to point out all of the mistakes
that he made and that he doesn’t realize. I’m not trying to do this to
be a pompous ass, as I am not successful by societal’s monetary
standards, yet. I also want others to be aware of people’s anecdotes.
With that being said, you need to read the entire article before you
proceed, as my commentary will make little sense if you don’t.

**Mistakes**

1.  Aaron believed that he could launch a startup and be profitable in a
    month. This is possible if we leave our definition of profitability
    at revenue minus expenses. If your expenses are your \$20 monthly
    server and you consider your time free, you could write some iPhone
    apps and be profitable almost right away. But, I think most people
    consider the definition of profitability when you achieve enough
    profit to start paying for most of your expenses. Otherwise known as
    ramen-noodle profitable.
2.  He wanted to spend his entire month coding. I made this mistake on
    my second startup. I really believed the “if you build it, they will
    come” line. It’s BS, you have to be talking to potential customers
    to validate their problems and your potential solutions. That is, if
    you’re not solving your own problem. Aaron doesn’t tell us what he’s
    building. But the fact remains, spending all of your time coding is
    a recipe for disaster. I know, I know, it’s a lot of fun, but you
    can’t do it. I really recommend that people research Steve Blank’s
    [Customer Development
    Methodology](http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation). 
3.  Being a good software engineer, he thought could build a kick-ass
    product that meant user requirements and that’s all he would do. The
    book the E-Myth writes about this rationale. Many people fall victim
    to this line of thinking, they just think about the fun part, e.g.
    writing code for a month. they often forget about what else is
    important in a business: marketing, accounting, discussing your
    ideas, contacting customers, etc.
4.  After twelve days of writing code, he scrapped everything. Very bad
    idea. Entrepreneurs need to focus on the [minimum viable
    product](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html)
    (MVP). He should have
    [shipped](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/fear-of-shipping.html)
    at twelve days to guage customer feedback.
5.  Dude… Aaron: why are you creating UML diagrams when you have only
    one month? See point \#4. This is over-engineering. [It’s all about
    the MVP, Obey Gall’s
    Law](http://techneur.com/post/656259481/mvp-galls-law).
6.  He thought he could do this in one month. I know, I mentioned this
    in \#1, but it’s the biggest mistake of all. This shit takes time.
    [It takes
    years](http://techneur.com/post/636853872/patience-success-takes-years)!

**In Defense of Aaron**

OK, so Aaron learned one lesson out of all of this, and perhaps it is
the most important lesson of all. It’s not that he necessarily should
have had a co-founder, but it’s that he should have been talking about
his idea since day one. I think he realizes that.

I would like to think that Aaron learned a lot more too. More about
code, more about himself. Hopefully, he had a bit of fun too.

To Aaron: I hope you don’t give up. Try, try, and try again. You’ll get
it eventually. Almost every successful entrepreneur has failed at least
once. Welcome to the world of entrepreneurship, I hope you enjoy the
ride.

Good luck.
