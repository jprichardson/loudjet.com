Use a Weakness to Develop a Strength
====================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l567lhkAUc1qzbc4f.jpg)

We all have weaknesses. We all have behaviors or personality traits that
we don’t like. I think that it’s possible to take some of these
behaviors, personality traits, or bad habits and do something positive
with them.

Are you’re introverted? You need to change that, but in the meantime use
the quiet time to focus and get work done. Are you a smoker? Engage in
conversation with other smokers, maybe you’ll make a business
connection. Do you waste a lot of time watching TV? Start a blog about
your favorite shows and analyze the characters and plots. Maybe you’ll
generate some side income. I realize that there are a lot of negative
personality traits and bad habits that it would be difficult to
capitalize upon all of them, but I think it’s worth a try.

So what’s mine? I believe that I have a small case of
[OCPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_personality_disorder)
not to be confused with
[OCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder).
In short, I can be a bit compulsive. Now, I have no professional
diagnosis of this, but I match the DSM’s diagnosis in most of the
categories. Oh well. So, how do I turn this into strengths?

-   I’m obsessive about being completely honest. I don’t consider white
    lies acceptable, and if I felt that I may have blurted out something
    that could be potentially misconstrued as not being true, I’ll make
    a point to correct it. I’ve ingrained in myself the moral code of
    integrity.
-   I’ve ran approximately 15 miles/week for the last two years.
-   I typically won’t allow myself to watch TV unless it’s a little
    sports or I’m on the treadmill.
-   I write daily.
-   Once I’m into a project, I find it very easy to kick ass on it. This
    is because I’ll obsess over it.

In short, I obsess over improving my relationships, health, and
professional career by working at it daily, but if I don’t do it daily,
I find it difficult, maybe even more difficult than the average person.

Look in the mirror and try to figure out if you can use your weaknesses
to develop strengths.

Do you think this is the case? Do you have any examples in your own life
to share? If so, please post.
