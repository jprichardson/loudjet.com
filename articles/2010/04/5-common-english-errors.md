5 Common Grammatical & Spelling Errors You Must Fix Now
=======================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0yee0otoL1qzbc4f.jpg)\
\
These errors are all too common. Now, I hope I’m not sounding like a
pompous ass… my writings are far from perfect. But, I can’t help but
notice these errors very frequently. So entrepreneurs, it’s time to
polish off that dusty English book from high-school and to actually open
a dictionary. Or, you could just visit [Common English
Errors](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html). Let this site be
your English bible.

​1) [A lot/alot](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/alot.html) - “alot”
is not a word. It’s “a lot.”

​2) [Could not care less/Could care
less](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/care.html) - Often you’ll see “I
could care less if”… if you could care less, that means that you
\*could\* actually care less.

​3) [For Sally & Me/For Sally &
I](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/myself.html) - The difference is
between what is a subject and what is the object. You bought the gift
for her. Steve came over to play basketball with Jim and me. Sally and I
went to the park.

​4) [You’re/your](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/your.html) - I see
this on Facebook all of the time. “You’re” is a contraction for “you
are” and “your” is the possessive form of you.

​5) [Ironically](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/ironically.html) -
This word is often misused when the person meant “coincidentally.”
Ironic means that which is contrary to what one expected.

future business.
