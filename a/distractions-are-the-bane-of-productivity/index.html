<h1>Distractions Are the Bane of Productivity</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8glhfpoAe1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I know many women who claim that they can multi-task very well. I think
it’s bullshit. The human brain isn’t wired to focus on more than one
task. It’s that very same reason why when you talk on the phone while
driving you may forget passing through intersections. Texting while
driving is even worse. I’m guilty.</p>
<p>I find it very hard to get stuff done without being distraction free. I
live in an apartment and my neighbor is obsessed with the TV… he watches
it all of the time. I sometimes wonder if the guy even sleeps. I have an
iPhone. It constantly chimes when a new email comes in. I also use
Gmail, which has integrated chat, many of times friends or family will
try to start a chat conversation throughout the day. Even worse are the
Twitter clients.</p>
<p>I think I’ve finally hit productivity zen. Looking back, it all started
with getting rid of my Twitter client. Twhril would prompt me every time
a tweet came in. Sure enough, after two days I realized I didn’t get
anything done. Plus, the web client is satisfactory. Next, I slowly
realized that having my Gmail tab open all of the time was killing
productivity as well, friends and family were too chatty. That had to go
too. I then decided that I had to drown out all of the surrounding noise
of living in an apartment. Nothing that a little
<a href="http://www.technobase.fm/">TechnoBase.fm</a> can’t solve.</p>
<p>See, us creatives need to get into the “zone” to do our best work.
Getting into the zone usually takes about 20 mins, and only seconds to
be knocked out. I thought I was close to being able to work at peak
productivity. Nope, something was still cutting in. Text messages and
phone calls. I then realized that my phone had to be turned off. I’ve
done all of these things and I was laser-focused last week. It was
unreal how much work that I accomplished.</p>
<p>This all sounds like a no-brainer, but unfortunately we humans can be
slow to pick up on some things. So I encourage you to ask yourself if
you’re at peak productivity. If not, what can you do to get there? Also,
if you feel the need to ask a coworker a question and you can clearly
see that they are working, make sure that your question is damn
important, or you might be knocking your coworker out of the “zone.”</p>
