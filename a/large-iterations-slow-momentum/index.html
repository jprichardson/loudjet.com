<h1>Large Iterations Slow Momentum</h1>

<p>… no shit Sherlock, huh? Sometimes you mistake the magnitude of a
product upgrade to be smaller than what it really is. That’s exactly
what <a href="http://reflect7.com">we</a> did for our next product upgrade. Not one
customer complained about the user interface. Not one customer
complained about the icons. But, customers did complain about the speed
of updates. Customers did complain about the data not being correct.
Customers did complain about lack of stats.</p>
<p>So where should we have focused all of our efforts for the next upgrade?
Yes, you guessed it! But we didn’t. We thought we needed to improve the
user interface and the icons along with all the rest. We have been
working on this iteration now for a little over two and half months.
That’s too long in today’s fast paced tech world. It could be argued
that the user interface was good enough and didn’t need to change. As my
business partner <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Brian</a> likes to say:
“Perfect is the enemy of good enough.”</p>
<p>I think the important take away is to really consider what your
customers are telling you. Let your <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Forget_Feature_Requests.php">customers be your
memory</a>.
But, if there is anything positive to say, we are sticking with this
goal; too often in the past, we’ve ditched current goals for others. I
sincerely believe that in business, focus can be one of your biggest
allies.</p>
