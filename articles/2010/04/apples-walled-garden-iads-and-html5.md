Apple's Walled Garden: iAds and html5:
======================================

![Apple's Walled
Garden](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1fcq7hEhz1qzbc4f.jpg)

Apple is building a wall around the lush garden that is the app store. 
Their end-game is to keep everybody happy by funneling mass amounts of
advertising monies.  How will this work?  Grab an Orange and follow me…

Jobs’s company needs to do two major things to capture consumers:

1.  Have the best content
2.  Offer that content for relatively nothing

This is where iAds comes into play.  Apple plans to launch iAds as a
premium advertising campaign, and has hinted at charging premium
prices.  With this in mind, developers can incorporate these emotionally
interactive ads as a viable revenue module.  Developers can focus on
delivering a great experience while Apple handles the monetization. 
It’s a win for consumers and it’s a win for developers. 

So who loses? Maybe no one.  If Apple has increased our content
consumption by making it more efficient (mobile), then they’ve just
created more eyespace for ads rather than taking it from someone else. 
With advertising budgets already in a stranglehold from cutbacks, I’m
inclined to believe the opposite.  Smart companies will wager their
advertising dollars towards a more interactive media.  Big Traditional
Media (BTM) will start to see their ad revenues fade.  Especially print,
until it migrates…

**As Apple gives developers a piece of their advertising pie, they’re
also building a wall to keep developers eating what they’re cooking. **

Here’s the brick and mortar:

​1) Apple just restricted the use of any interpretive language or
language other than Objective C.

-   This makes it that much harder for developers to transfer their apps
    across platforms.  Apple just burned down [Titanium’s
    bridge](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-cross-platform-application-development/ "Titanium: Cross-Platform App Development").

​2) Apple just restricted anyone from sending any app analytics out of
the app.

-   This hinders the targeting of other ad networks.  As a side effect,
    it also makes it impossible for developers to gauge user experience
    (not good Apple).  I’d be very surprised if they didn’t come out
    with some sort of standard analytics platform.

It’s easy to see how Apple will incorporate their own ad system:

I predict they’ll either classify ads themselves or have users
classify/keyword their ads in order to define what consumer group each
ad should target.

I also predict that iAds will be smarter ads.  Since each one has a
category attached to them (see prediction above), the ad-showcasing
algorithm can send data back to Apple’s servers on what ads that user
has been responding to.  That users responds great to restaurant ads? 
Great, send them some more restaurant ads…

But what about html5.  Why won’t other networks jump on board?  Apple
can’t stop other ad networks from implementing html5 ads.  What they can
do is filter out the bad ones (see app approval process) and deliver the
most well-targeted ads to date since they have access to all of the user
data.  The more well-targeted, the higher the CTR, which means that more
developers will be motivated to create apps for users.  This is what
Apple is banking on and if you take a look at user’s time spent mobile
searching vs. mobile app time (30 mins/day), they’re right.

This strategy, however crude, could make the iPhone the developers
platform of choice while other platforms (google) are left in the wake.
