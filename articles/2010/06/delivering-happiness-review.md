Delivering Happiness Review
===========================

At the End of [Big Omaha
2010,](http://loudjet.com/a/big-omaha-2010 "Big Omaha 2010 Recap")
[Tony Hsieh](http://twitter.com/zappos "Follow Tony on Twitter"), of
[Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/ "zappos.com"), pulled an Oprah move and
gave the entire audience his new book [*Delivering
Happiness*](http://deliveringhappinessbook.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7469caef6122a4c94f2c5e38e&id=ace950be67&e=89541698b8 "deliveringhappinessbook.com").
His presentation was outstanding. Tony connected the business
cornerstones of customer service and company culture with life’s pursuit
of happiness. The results were very interesting and quite profound.

**Summary**

The book breaks down into five primary sections:

1.  The first 50 or so pages detail Tony’s entrepreneurial spirit as a
    youth. From building a worm farm and operating a pizza joint to
    selling Link Exchange for 265 Million. Here, the Zappos CEO is still
    searching for his higher purpose.
2.  Following is a transition period that takes place over the next 40
    pages. Tony begins to reflect and understand when he is happy the
    most - when sharing experiences with friends. He goes out of his way
    to recreate this environment and also starts his own VC firm.
3.  From pages 90-130, we see Tony integrate into Zappos as the young
    company struggles with funding to survive.
4.  For the next 100 pages, we see the Zappos culture crystallize as
    Tony applies his thoughts on happiness to the company core values.
    The young CEO connects the dots leading to over 1 billion annual
    sales in 2008. This section is the “Meat and Potatos” of the book
    sprinkled with Zappos excerpts.
5.  In the final 10 or so pages, Tony writes about the similarities of
    happiness from both personal and business levels. He helps his
    readers find their goal in life and outlines three types of
    happiness: Pleasure, Passion, and Higher Purpose. This section is
    very insightful and worth the price alone.

**Review**

*Delivering Happiness*is a very light and easy read. However, it’s not a
fast and furious like
[Rework](http://loudjet.com/a/rework "Rework Review"). The
book could have been about 80 pages shorter. Some parts were very boring
and redundant. Mainly, the actual Zappos excerpts and the anecdotes from
employees. They were overkill. I didn’t need a lot of personal examples
because Tony was very clear about the Zappos’ culture and [core
values](http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values "Zappos Core Values").
One of those values being “Do more with less.

The good news is that you get an entire picture of where Tony is coming
from and what Zappos has done to enjoy such insane success. There are a
lot of gems to be unearthed in *Delivering Happiness*, here’s a few:

1.  Everything you do is marketing. Put the money you would spend on
    advertising back into your core competencies (like customer service,
    shipping, selection, and product development). Happy customers will
    return for the great service/product and most likely tell their
    friends. Especially if you:
2.  WOW them. Wow your customers. Give them such exceptional service
    that it stands out. For repeat customers, Zappos will upgrade the
    shipping class to overnight. Since they are located right next to a
    UPS hub, the customers can receive their items in less than 12 hours
    (sometimes eight!). Now that’s WOW.
3.  Your culture is your brand. When you get the culture right,
    everything else will fall into place. You don’t need scripts for a
    calling center. Instead, hire and train employees to align with your
    company’s culture. Then, let them infuse their personality within
    their service. This gives the customer a unique and personal touch
    and gives the employee a creative way to express themselves. When
    did you have that the last time you worked for “The Man?”
4.  Be humble. Be a servant-type leader. Your job as management is to
    get your employees functioning on all four cylinders and then get
    out of the way. By facilitating communication, you allow the people
    on the front lines to improve the company from the bottom-up.
5.  Develop your company to follow a higher purpose. Zappos’ purpose is
    to Deliver Happiness to their customers, employees, and vendors. The
    result is more returning customers, more productive and creative
    employees, and great vendor relationships.

Tony and the Zappos forefathers have done something unique here. They’ve
built a company that delivers happiness. This book is a must read for
anyone building their own company, involved in customer service, or who
just wants to attain happiness. It’s also great for a behind-the-scenes
look at the stepping stones a billion dollar company takes as it comes
into its own.

4 out of 5 Stars.
