<h1>Loyalty</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7a0vd4uLw1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">Corey, Brian, and I</a> ate dinner at
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=bistro+121+omaha,ne">Bistro
121</a>
on Saturday night. The food was tender, the martinis were delicious, and
the service was friendly. As the check came we gave the server our \$50
off coupon. The server told us to keep the coupon because she knew that
we enjoyed the evening that we would be back. She was building loyal
customers.</p>
<p>Loyalty is one of the most underused business methods to achieve
success. People often forget that it costs much more to gain a new
customer than it is to make your existing customers happy. Brian is the
founder of another company named Apparel Unlimited. He sells high-end
clothing to European customers. Brian has found that when he includes an
extra gift in the packages for repeat customers, they are grateful and
in many cases buy from him again. Zappos commonly upgrades repeat
customers shipping to overnight.</p>
<p>This works and many business owners forget this. Leverage loyalty and
<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/08/the-right-price-the-first-time.html">give the best price the first
time</a>
and youâ€™ll be on your way to building a successful business.</p>
