Commitment vs Involvement
=========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8o8jhoY2M1qzbc4f.jpg)

This cartoon reminded me of the old saying: “At breakfast, [a chicken is
involved, but a pig is
committed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig).”

I wrote a post about how you should [work until your eyes
bleed](http://techneur.com/post/1041263868/work-until-your-eyes-bleed).
The post is very short, but to summarize: the post is about how
entrepreneurs need to step up and kick their own ass in order to
succeed. Go read it. I’ll wait.

Read it? OK…

A very successful entrepreneur, Steve Kiene, posted a comment that I
thought needed to be shared.

Wow. He’s right on the money! I use to believe that all that was needed
for a company to be successfully bootstrapped was to have enough
positive cash flow. In our case, I figured if we could average \$350 -
\$400 in revenue a day for at least six months, that should be
sufficient. Assuming very little expenses, 10.5k - 12k per month isn’t
bad for a small [three-man startup](http://reflect7.com/about-us),
right? Monetarily speaking, of course.

But you see, startups need more than money. A startup is you and your
business partners’ baby. It needs love, time, attention, and most
importantly commitment. Much like rich parents can be crappy parents,
high cashflow startups without commitment can and will fail. Don’t
delude yourself on believing that just because you’re involved that
you’re committed. You’re committed when your startup comes right up to
the point we’re you’ve considered prioritizing it above your most basic
necessities.

This requires you to give up drinking with your buddies as much as you
do. This requires you to stop watching TV. Quit taking naps. Movies on
Sunday? Forget about it. Your startup is your first priority. I’m not
claiming that you should completely neglect your family, as you need to
keep some perspective. But you can definitely cut a lot of crap out of
your life.

To quote [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html):

> Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your
> whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low
> intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for
> four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a
> premium for working fast.

Think about? It makes a lot of sense. Work your ass off now so that you
don’t have to later in life. So that you can make decisions on how to
spend your time any way that you like. Reclaim your time.

To paraphrase [Gary
Vaynerchuk](http://video.garyvaynerchuk.com/keynotes):

> Come home, kiss your dog, kiss your wife and get to work. I’m
> completely obsessed with the fact that most people own 16 hours of day
> to do things as they please. A person working from 6 PM - 2 AM a few
> nights a week can do a lot of damage. You need to work your faces off.

Do you have it in you? Are you committed or are you just involved?
