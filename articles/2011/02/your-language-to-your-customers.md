Your Language to Your Customers
===============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgmsduoiLw1qzbc4f.jpg)

I sent a company an email about their non-working product. They
responded:

> Hello. Our developers are aware of this issue and will fix it as soon
> as they can.
>
> Thanks for your patience!

I hadn’t demonstrated patience yet, as this was my first email.

I’ve been guilty of saying this to customers too. You say it so that
customers may feel a bit apprehensive about contacting you again.
They’ll think “am I not being patient?” and just maybe think twice about
bugging you with another email. It’s very effective. But it’s a bit
offputting.

The most egregious language that you can use is related to the apology.

> We’re sorry for any inconvenience that we may have caused.
