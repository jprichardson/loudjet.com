<h1>Not the Entrepreneur&#39;s Manifesto</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhgrvgFJga1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Did you ever read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto">Hacker’s
Manifesto</a>? If not, you
can read it <a href="http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/manifesto.html">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.technozen.com/manifesto.htm">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&amp;id=3#article">here</a>. I
thought it made sense to link to it more than once just in case you read
this post years later and one of the links is dead. I remember when I
first read it. It was almost 12 years ago. It sent chills down my spine.
It made me feel like I was part of something special, something that
just transcended my everyday life.</p>
<p>A piece of literature circulated today that caught my eye. It’s titled:
<a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/mv/M2/ventura.html">Someone is Stealing Your
Life</a>. You should read it. I
read the first few paragraphs, it felt like he was building a case for
entrepreneurship. I was blinded by my open enthusiasm by how it made me
feel. I thought this literary piece was going to turn out to be like the
Hacker’s Manifesto. I thought it was the Entrepreneur’s Manifesto. And
then I got mid-way through… and realized that the whole entire essay is
a self-defeating piece of garbage.</p>
<p><strong>You have a <em>choice</em>.</strong> </p>
<p>You can work for someone else, or you can work for yourself. You can
reduce your expenditures. You can opt to use your free time to learn or
build a business.</p>
<p>But you have a choice. Don’t ever let yourself believe otherwise, you’ll
only set yourself up for failure.</p>
