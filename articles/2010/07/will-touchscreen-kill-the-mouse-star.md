Will Touchscreen Kill the Mouse Star?
=====================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5a5tpl10E1qzbc4f.jpg)

Please pardon the [lame
joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star). But
this is an issue that every web designer and entrepreneur needs to
consider. [Sales of
touchscreen](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1313415) enabled
devices are booming. Much like the desktop revolution of the early 80’s,
we are upon another revolution.

How should this affect our products? The predominate concern is that
many web apps today use [CSS
hover](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes)
capabilities i.e. you move your mouse over something on a webpage and
some action happens. It could be a tooltip, menu, color change, or
additional functionality shown.

Trent Walton wrote a [great article on the hover
issue](http://trentwalton.com/2010/07/05/non-hover/). Trent writes:

He’s right. I love a clean minimalistic design. A design that doesn’t
show much, but just enough to get the job done. It’s very easy to add
functionality without compromising the original design by incorporating
the use of the hover. That’s the problem. It’s almost as if we must
design for touchscreen devices first. But, maybe the best solution is
just to focus your design on showing everything from the get go.

Focusing on showing all of your content seems like an ideal solution if
you want to develop your
[MVP](http://techneur.com/post/656259481/mvp-galls-law) fast. However, I
don’t think it’s the “best” solution. I think the best solution is that
we’ll have to develop two interfaces. However, starting with a touch
enabled interface is the best way to get up going quickly.

I believe that the “mouse star” is here to stay. One thing is for sure,
we can’t ignore this issue. What do you think?
