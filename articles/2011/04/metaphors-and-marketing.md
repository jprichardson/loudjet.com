Metaphors and Marketing
=======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk0a9tcQIU1qzbc4f.jpg)

I just stumbled upon an article titled: “[How to Create Advertising that
Sells](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2879-1900-word-ad-how-to-create-advertising).”
Point 29 is about having a lot of words in a headline. Whether there is
merit in this or not, that’s not my point. My point is one that I’m
surprised isn’t listed in one of the articles 38 points. Point 29 has
this statement: 

> “At 60 miles an hours, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes
> from the electric clock.”

Prospects don’t care about the length of the headline. In fact, it’s not
the length that matters (hehehehe… see what I did there?). It’s the
imagery that the statement or picture portrays.

Is the following statement better or worse?

> “Our Rolls-Royce is really quiet.”

It’s worse. But not because it’s shorter. This statement does not paint
a picture in your mind.

Metaphors paint pictures in the minds of people. Pictures aid stories.
Stories sell products. Use metaphors in advertising.
