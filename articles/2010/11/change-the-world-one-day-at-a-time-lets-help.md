Change the World One Day at a Time: Let's Help Wikipedia
========================================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc34llX0Zd1qzbc4f.jpg)

I’m on a mission to change the world. Yes, I know how cliche that phrase
sounds. But the feeling is true. Each day, I ask myself: “what can I do
to help make this world a better place?” Most days, I’m pretty sure that
I’m making a small dent. But what if we all made small dents of
improvement each day… how would the world change?

The other day I was reading Wikipedia and I saw the
[banner](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/WMFJA010/en/US?utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_campaign=20101117BT01&utm_source=2010_JA1_Banner6C_US&country_code=US)
with the personal appeal from [Jimmy
Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales). I ignored it. However,
I visit the site quite often. After awhile, I couldn’t ignore it. I knew
that I had to do something, as I get so much utility out of the site.

This is my attempt. I will match any donation up until the sum of all of
my donations total \$500. Here’s what you need to do:

1.  [Visit the donation
    page.](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/WMFJA010/en/US?utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_campaign=20101117BT01&utm_source=2010_JA1_Banner6B_US&country_code=US)
2.  Donate any amount.
3.  Forward me [jp [AT] reflect7.com] your donation receipt.
4.  I’ll then make my matching donation and then forward you my receipt.
    We’ll both have warm fuzzies about donating to a great organization!
    =)

If you’ve ever gotten any utility out of Wikipedia, please consider
donating. Even if it’s \$5… that helps.

Check back to this page for my total contribution, as I would hate for
you to donate after I’ve hit \$500 and expect for me to match it.

Reader Donations: **\$60**\
JP Donations: **\$60**

Thanks for your help, together we can truly change the world.
