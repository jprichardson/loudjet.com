Thorn in Your Side
==================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lcot6t9XKj1qzbc4f.jpg)

We all have that thorn in our side. Something we want to change. It’s
that nagging thought that keeps pissing us off. Most likely it’s
something we want to change about ourselves or our lives. Maybe you want
to lose weight? Maybe you want to be a better writer? Maybe you want to
be self-employed? Maybe you want to spend more time with your kids?
Maybe you want to be a better speaker? The list goes on. However, each
day that thought is on your mind, that thorn is in your side.

You must work everyday to remove that thorn. It takes continual
commitment. You must create “deposits” daily. You won’t see results
overnight. No one ever does. Give it five years… at least.
