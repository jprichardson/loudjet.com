<h1>Be Exceptional and People Will Market For You</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3s3d6idBH1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I remember the first day I walked into a Jimmy John’s Sandwich
Restaurant. You know, the ones with the “Subs so fast you’ll freak”
slogan. I had the day off so I wasn’t very concerned about speed, just
taste. I ordered the JJ Gargantuan and chatted with the cashier while I
searched for the correct change. When I looked up to pay, she was
holding the Gargantuan. They had literally made the sandwich in 30
seconds. I was WOWed and, just like their slogan says, I was freaking.
This experience has stuck with me over the past five years. Now it’s
finding it’s way onto techneur. Can you say marketing?</p>
<p>Tony Hseih of <a href="http://www.zappos.com" title="zappos.com">Zappos</a> uses the term
“WOW.” Zappos first core value is to <a href="http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values/deliver-wow-through-service">Deliver WOW Through
Service</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WOW is such a short, simple word, but it really encompasses a lot of
things. To WOW, you must differentiate yourself, which means doing
something a little unconventional and innovative. You must do
something that’s above and beyond what’s expected. And whatever you do
must have an emotional impact on the receiver. We are not an average
company, our service is not average, and we don’t want our people to
be average. We expect every employee to deliver WOW.</p>
<p>Whether internally with co-workers or externally with our customers
and partners, delivering WOW results in word of mouth. Our philosophy
at Zappos is to WOW with service and experience, not with anything
that relates directly to monetary compensation (for example, we don’t
offer blanket discounts or promotions to customers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jimmy John’s understands this mantra. They keep their restaurant fully
staffed, even during some slow hours, so they can deliver the WOW
moments when it counts. They might be running up the labor percentage
but that’s only short term. Soon, word of mouth will spread and more
customers will file in.</p>
<p>Jimmy John’s is also saving on marketing. Word of mouth is the must
trusted form of advertising. If the sandwich franchise continues to WOW
people with their speed, then stories of their service will be passed
along just as this one is now. With one person being able to reach
hundreds and possibly thousands via facebook, twitter, blogs, etc., a
good story can go a long way.</p>
<p>There is a catch. Because Jimmy John’s markets themselves on speed of
service, that speed could become the new baseline for their customers.
Patrons will come to expect speedy service and that attribute will lose
it’s WOW factor. Jimmy John’s should take a page out of the Zappos
handbook (<a href="http://www.deliveringhappinessbook.com/" title="eliveringhappinessbook.com">Delivering
Happiness</a>)
and create a company culture that embraces employee creativity and
personality. This way, employees can inject their unique WOW factor into
each interaction. There would be no way for customers to baseline
expectations, because WOW experiences would vary depending on the
employee.</p>
<p>Hell, if I were Jimmy John’s I would pay a driver extra to deliver
sandwiches in a chicken suit. That would be hilarious and make for a
great story.</p>
<p>Since reading Delivering Happiness, I’ve been coming up with ways to WOW
my international clothing customers and deliver great service. Here’s a
few:</p>
<ol>
<li>Throw in a an accessory, like a bracelet or necklace, for free on
repeat buyers. These items fit just about every guy and they’ll
never see it coming.</li>
<li>Pay all VAT fees, no matter what. Sometimes, Europeans are charged a
customs duty when purchasing from countries outside of the Union.
Customers will appreciate this “safety net” given the uncertainty of
a potential hidden cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s one way you could WOW your customers?</p>
