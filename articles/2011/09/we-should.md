We Should...
============

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrezvrTMXf1qzbc4f.jpg)

How often do you run into someone that you use to be close friends and
you have a dialogue that is similar to this:

> You: How have you been?
>
> Them: Good! Good… how have you been?
>
> You: Oh, good… so what’s new?
>
> Them: Oh you know… same old… we should get together sometime for lunch
> or something.
>
> You: Ya, let’s do.
>
> Them: OK, well it was nice seeing you…
>
> You: You too… take care.

How do you feel after a conversation like this? Do you feel like you
have renewed your connection with this person? It seems to me that a lot
of conversations like this take place solely because it might be
considered socially rude to not acknowledge the person. Maybe the intent
of the statement “we should get together” is sincere?

A lot of people in my life have thrown out “we should” statements, but
with no firm date set. “Hey man… it was great meeting you at that
conference, we should Skype sometime” or “Hey, we should get some
cocktails sometime.” I’m sure they happen all of the time in your life
as well. Maybe you say them a lot?

Recently, I ran into an old colleague at the gym. We had a bit of small
chit-chat and I threw out the “we should get some lunch” line, I was
even being sincere about it. A few weeks passed. Shit, no lunch. One
day, I sent him an email and said “want to do lunch?” He couldn’t, and
replied that he was busy for awhile. Not a big deal.

The important take away is this: it’s really important to consider your
interactions with others. If you catch yourself saying the “we should”
lines, ask yourself if you’re being sincere. If you are, set a date at
that moment… if it doesn’t work that’s OK too. When it really comes down
to it, if you really care to meet someone, you’ll make it a priority.
They’ll do the same for you. If the meeting doesn’t happen, you should
probably just accept that this person isn’t a priority to you or you
might not be a priority to them. That’s OK too.

If you’re not sincere about meeting this person, please don’t throw out
a “we should” line. You’ll save everyone, including yourself, a bit of
guilt about the meeting not happening.

What are your thoughts?
