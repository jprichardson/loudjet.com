Disconnect to Recharge
======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4y8cmxLzx1qzbc4f.jpg)

I’m on my way to Dallas with my fiance and friend. I spent some time
trying to write a blog post, but I realized it wasn’t that good. I
closed my laptop.

I was thinking that road trips can be a waste of time because of all of
the hours not producing. It instantly hit me, that not everything has to
be about business. And sometimes just enjoying conversation is more
important than anything else at the moment.

Happy 4th of July!
