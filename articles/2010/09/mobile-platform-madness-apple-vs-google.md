Mobile Platform Madness: Apple vs. Google
=========================================

**Platform Madness**

Over the past year-and-a-half, Reflect7 has been dealing with Apple as
our sole mobile platform…and it almost killed us.

Like other developers, we invested hundreds of man hours into a product,
only to have it denied after a three week review process. That sort of
lag will take the steam out of any engine. Our second denial nearly
crippled us. Then, we did something crazy: we communicated to Apple. Our
reviewer was very helpful. During the next update, our apps made it to
the store without a hitch.

Those stomach pains have been eliminated in the Android App Market. In
an open-ecosystem, it’s much nicer. No worries about delays or denials
from a cumbersome review process. The App Market is still messy, but
Google arrived 6 months late to the app game and 22 months late to the
mobile phone OS game.

So where do we anticipate the most revenue? Right now, it’s Apple. We
have more apps in their store with some decent exposure. As we convert
more of our apps to the Android Market, I see the revenue for both
platforms equaling out. I used to think that Apple would dominate.
However, as I look back to the beginning of our iPhone apps, I didn’t
see near as much traction as I’m seeing on the Android.

**Advantage: Apple**

The Apple App Store has paid out an outstanding 1B to it’s developers.
That’s insane. The Google App Market has paid out around 21-24M. That’s
about 2.4% of Apple’s payout. Here’s some of the contributing factors: 

-   The Apple App Store has about 6x as many paid apps on it (3x as many
    apps). 
-   Apple had first mover advantage by 6 months coupled with a superior
    mass of OS users at launch time
-   Google failed to Launch with paid apps and, to this day, still
    doesn’t have paid apps in several App Market countries.
-   Apple had a distribution model and active customers with the
    already-established iTunes at Launch.
-   When comparing payouts, Google app numbers are inflated. A ton of
    these apps are spam apps that wouldn’t even make it on the Apple App
    Store.

The first-mover advantage is huge because that gave Apple the ability to
lock developers in for an entire development cycle. We ran into this.
Why would we allocate resources to develop for a new platform when we’re
already busting balls to just get out our next iPhone update?
Eventually, we outsourced the job, finished our development cycle, and
came back to tweak before releasing.

**Less Developers = Less Competition**

Our apps will perform well on the Android because there’s an obvious gap
in competition and an exponentially increasing user base.

Some have said that Android users don’t buy apps. Supposedly, Apple
users spend more per app, buy more apps, and shit skittles. I call
bullshit. Apple users aren’t any different than Android users when it
comes to their app-purchasing DNA. As stated above, the number of
purchase-worthy apps on the Android is significantly less than iOS.
Apple also has better search functionality and prefilters quality.

The best way to work against the spam is to position yourself above it.
By pricing ourselves higher than everybody else in our field, we’re
portraying greater quality. Customers probe deeper by checking our app
description and detailed pics. The Android market gives them a 24 hour
grace period with every app so users can decide for themselves. The
important part here is to attract attention with the initial price
positioning.

**Conclusion**

Customers gravitate towards user experience and developers follow
customers. But rather quickly, Google has stepped up it’s game in terms
of user-experience (I just got the Samsung Fascinate and it rocks) and
OS adoption. It’s open platform policy gives Android a huge
number-of-device advantage. That little robot is showing up on all sorts
of phones. Despite all of Apple’s initial advantages, the Android OS is
narrowing the gap.

The cool thing for us is that developers are still flocking to the
iPhone because reports are showing little aggregate revenue for the App
Market. They aren’t realizing that a little piece of a huge Apple Pie is
the same as a huge piece of a litte Google Pie. For our sake, I hope
they keep listening :)
