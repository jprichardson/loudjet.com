How Bad Do You Want It?
=======================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ikqa9hfY1qzbc4f.jpg)

I remember the feeling as if it were yesterday. It was 3:30 AM and I
took a few minutes to clear my mind and step away from my senior
project. I was about two months away from graduation from
[UNL](http://www.unl.edu) with a degree in Computer Engineering and a
degree in Electrical Engineering. At this time, I probably had about
three SoBe No Fear energy drinks… it felt as if my kidneys and liver
were crying in pain. As I walked in the hall of the engineering building
the lights were dimly lit. I saw a plaque with pictures of other
students who had graduated the year before me. I was stressed. I was
tired. I was running on about two hours of sleep each day. I had already
been married and divorced, I am a single father. I am a
[survivor](http://blog.startupprofessionals.com/2010/02/entrepreneurs-are-survivors-never.html).
I was two months away from one of the biggest changes in my life! “How
bad do you want it JP?” I said to myself. There was no turning back, I
couldn’t turn back. I couldn’t quit. It was the last semester of my
college career! I could feel the excitement building. That phrase always
stuck with me: “how bad do you want it?”

How bad do you want it? How bad do you want graduate from college? How
bad do you want that promotion? How bad do you want to complete a
half-marathon? How bad do you want to build a successful business? How
bad do you want to quit smoking? How bad do you want to eat healthier?
How bad do you want it? You can accomplish any of these if you work hard
enough and set your mind to it.

Around the 1st of the year, I’m always amused when people ask me what is
my New Year’s resolution. I always respond: “I don’t believe in New
Year’s resolutions.” I usually always get a blank stare. I then proceed
with “if there is something that I want to improve upon or accomplish, I
try very hard to start today. Starting at a later date doesn’t force me
to be serious.” Now, this doesn’t mean that I think a person shouldn’t
have a New Year’s resolution. Everyone is different. But in general, I
think they’re bunk. I’m reminded of the quote from the movie [Vanilla
Sky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/): Sofia says to the main
character: “every minute is a new chance to start over.” That’s how I
see it. You can accomplish your goals and make changes [one day at a
time](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/11/11/taking-dramatic-change-one-day-at-a-time/).

You can accomplish your goals. You can have your dreams. You don’t even
have to [sacrifice your
health](http://blog.asmartbear.com/sacrifice-your-health-for-your-startup.html),
and you shouldn’t. Your [comfort is not
important](http://www.illuminatedmind.net/2009/10/01/your-comfort-is-not-important/)
and there is [no
sideways](http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/the-neutral-fallacy-there-is-no-sideways-in-life/)
in life, you’re always improving or weakening. [Don’t sacrifice the
short-term](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/08/06/the-short-term-and-the-long-term-choice/)
for the long-term. Your [time is an
investment](http://loudjet.com/a/dont-have-the-time). Take
one day at a time.

How bad do you want it?
