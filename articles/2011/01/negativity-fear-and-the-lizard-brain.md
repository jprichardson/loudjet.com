Negativity, Fear, and the Lizard Brain
======================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lex32ktvDr1qzbc4f.jpg)

If you catch yourself saying words like…

“We can’t compete with…”

“It’ll never happen!”

“I’m afraid that…”

These statements are based on negativity and fear. They are poisonous
thoughts. You can compete. Competition validates the market. If Mark
Zuckerberg was worried about competing with MySpace, we wouldn’t have
Facebook. If Steve Jobs accepted the carrier-dominate mobile phone
industry, we wouldn’t have the iPhone.

You must [quiet the lizard
brain](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html).
