Regret Minimization Framework
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldfrjxx18k1qzbc4f.jpg)

It sounds nerdy, but it’s very straightforward. The idea is that with
any major decision in life, you should consider what you’ll think of
that decision when you’re 80. Will you regret making that decision? Will
you regret not making that decision? It’s essentially living life with
no regrets.

Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon, coined the term Regret
Minimization Framework. Watch this YouTube clip:

something similar:

RMF or “Living Life with No Regrets” has served me well. When faced with
any major decision, I just ask myself: Will I regret doing this? Will I
regret not doing this? Up to this point, I only have two major regrets.
Not bad for only being 27.

Do you use RMF?
