<h1>The Trap Is Your Mind</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6xtktwm261qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A few weeks back, I had a sobering experience. An experience that has
stuck with me and something that I wanted to share. I was at my good
friend Phil’s house and we were talking life over beers. All of a
sudden, he broke down into tears. Phil burst out, ”I don’t know what I’m
going to do? I feel trapped.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. How can my good friend, who seemed to have everything
together, be so distraught? He went on. “I hate my job. I had a meeting
with my boss a few weeks ago and he said that there won’t be a promotion
for at least five years. I hate what I do and It’s a dead end.”</p>
<p>I responded, “So what do you want to do? What type of business do you
want to start?” For some dubious reason, I always think that everyone
wants to start a business. Phil went on to explain that he couldn’t, he
had house payments to make and was the primary supporter for himself and
his wife. The gut-wrenching part was when he said, “Guess what we’re
doing tomorrow? Going to check out a house that’s in a better
neighborhood that costs 50% more than this house.” He saw my confused
face and went on as if the plan made sense, “We can refinance right now
with the same monthly payments, and Carol really wants it.”</p>
<p>My stomach turned knots - his wife didn’t know how he felt. Phil had put
the burden of high living on his shoulders early and had been carrying
it through his horrible job for the last four years. His suppressed
feelings had finally burst through in a moment of vulnerability. I could
see where he was coming from. In his mind, if he quit his job, then they
would have to sell their current house. This was a non-choice for Phil -
he wasn’t about to disappoint his wife or her parents. He didn’t want to
be perceived as a “deadbeat failure-of-a-husband.” If they kept on, or
even worse, purchased the larger house, he would have be miserable every
day at his job. For Phil, there was no way out.</p>
<p>Phil fell into the trap of valuing imposed expectations over his own
wellbeing. Not only did he put everybody’s expectations on his
shoulders, but he also expected himself to be living big. I’ve been
around people when they talk about other’s losing their house. Usually,
it’s the deathstroke, “OMG, can you beleive that they lost their house?
OMG! OMG! OMG!” Why is it such a big deal? Scaling back can be a good
thing. Selling a house can get you out of debt and make your life much
more flexible. Now, you don’t have an overbearing asset to constantly
fund. We’re so used to the graduate, get job, get house, start family
routine that our life goes on autopilot. Scoot that asshole over and
grab the wheel. You’re flying this thing and you can go wherever you
want. Just make sure you have fun doing it.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong></p>
<p>TV culture, social norms, advertising, and consumer-driven media has us
fooled. Our brain, left unchecked, will create positive associations
with consumerism that have no basis in reality. Some people have bought
into this all the way. Others have a little. I’ll admit, I’m guilty of
dreaming up a house I’ll own one day with a pool, walk-in fridge, and
four extra bed rooms. Really, that’s just more maintenance, more
cleaning, and more distractions.</p>
<p>Happiness is about doing stuff you love and are passionate about. It’s
about having fun and control over your life. Have you ever had really
fun night with your friends just sitting around drinking Bud Light?
Would you of had more fun if you were drinking crystal in a
giant mansion? When you die, you can’t take your toys with you. If
you’re happy and live in a cardboard box, wtf is the difference?</p>
<p>I’ll end with this appropriate quote by Tyler Durden: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever
lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it,
an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white
collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, <strong>working jobs
we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need</strong>. We’re the middle children
of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great
Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is
our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day
we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but
we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed
off.</p>
