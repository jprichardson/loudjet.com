The Two-Second Rule
===================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2l7gn46uE1qzbc4f.jpg)

No, I’m not referring to the [driving
rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-second_rule). I’m referring to
conversations.

I love conversing about three things: people, business, and technology.
When any conversation involves any of the aforementioned topics (most
do), I get really excited. I love to learn more about the other person,
their background, their business, and technologies used to improve their
lives.

So what’s the problem? I get so excited, that I want to ask questions or
chime in with an opinion before the other person is finished talking.
That’s annoying to other person and inconsiderate. I recently read about
the two second rule on [Little Things
Matter](http://littlethingsmatter.com). The concept is simple. When
someone is done talking, wait two seconds before you respond to ensure
that they are finished. Easy peasy.

Your conversations will be better, more meaningful, and the other party
will think that you’re a better listener. A win for everyone.
