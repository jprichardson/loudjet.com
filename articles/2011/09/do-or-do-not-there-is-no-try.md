Do or Do Not; There Is No Try
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrzhmzPr721qzbc4f.jpg)

Do you remember that seen in Star Wars where Master Yoda is training
Luke to become a Jedi? Luke doesn’t believe in himself and he claims
that he is *trying*.

Yoda then says “Do or do not; there is no try.”

Do you want to quit smoking?

Do you want to live a healthy lifestyle?

Do you want to be a successful entrepreneur?

There is no *try*.

The word ‘try’ is an excuse. You cannot ‘try’ to quit smoking. You
cannot try to become a successful entrepreneur. You know what you need
to do. You need to make the conscious decision and effort to do it.

To be a successful entrepreneur is as simple as this:

1.  Identify a problem.
2.  Build a solution to solve that problem.
3.  Charge money for it.

I realize that this is a bit of an oversimplification. But, there is no
‘try’. You should just remove that word from your vocabulary.

Do or do not. There is no try.
