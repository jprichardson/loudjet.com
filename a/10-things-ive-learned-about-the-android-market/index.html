<h1>10 Things I&#39;ve Learned About the Android Market</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8sd0vYX7c1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>About seven months ago, <a href="http://reflect7.com">Reflect7</a> decided to
diversify it’s B2C platforms by allocating resources towards the Android
Market. The phones were selling faster than Justin Bieber tickets and
their App Store was just as young. The fact that our Senior Mobile
Programmer (he likes us to call him that), Corey, couldn’t get service
inside of our apartment made the Verizon-Android combo even more
appealing.</p>
<p>Months passed and we finally started the upload process. The one thing
we kept hearing over and over again was that Android users don’t buy
apps. We were freaked. We uploaded our first app a month ago. Here’s
what I’ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>In general, Android apps are twice as spammy and half the quality of
iPhone apps. In the sports section, we had little competition in
terms of quality. There were news apps and a few roster apps, but no
apps that combined all of the features we had. It is obvious that
mobile developers are still spending a lot of their resources on the
iPhone and then porting to the android as a secondary platform.</li>
<li>Just like the early days of the App Store, the Android Market has
massive keyword spamming that goes unchecked. Titles are clean but
the app descriptions contain keywords that reference other popular
apps.</li>
<li>There’s also frequent IP rights infringement. I ran across hundreds
of themed (wallpaper) apps in the sports section. All of them toted
the official logo of each team. The majority of them were charging
money. However, if the IP owner contacts Google, they will remove
the apps. This happened for many of the unofficial NBA apps.</li>
<li>People ARE paying for apps. I saw wallpaper apps that had hundreds
of sales at \$1. When I saw this, I knew that Android users would
pay for something that provided utility. Our first upload is at
almost 100 sales within it’s first month at \$1.99.</li>
<li>You can’t revert to a paid app once you have set your app to free.
Found this little quark out after it was too late and had to upload
a newer-versioned apk.</li>
<li>Ranks seem to be based on download rate. I’ve seen apps with a
smaller base show up before an app that had a huge base. It also may
have something to do with current installs. Can’t make much of it
yet.</li>
<li>Once you upload your app, it’s on the Market. No delay or cumbersome
approval process.</li>
<li>Google displays robust stats. App sales, active downloads, error
reports, reviews, and comments are updated 2-3 times a day. You can
view and download all of the Google checkout stats for each of your
customers for any chosen time period. This includes info like phone
number, name, state, etc.</li>
<li>There’s a straightforward app uploading process. Self-signing and a
one-page form make it pretty easy for developers to dive in.</li>
<li>Google has a return policy that takes some getting used to. Users
have 24 hours to cancel any order. These orders are marked as
Chargeable. If a user doesn’t cancel, the order is charged. We’re
running at a 19.7% cancel rate. This strategy fits perfectly into
Google’s open-ecosystem policy. Users have a trial period with an
app and if they delete it within 24 hours, they’re refunded. This
truly gives the user the final say in quality control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I’m impressed. Google has done a lot with their Android Market.
They stay out of the developer’s way and let customers decide app
quality. They have great reports and give users a grace period to weed
out low-quality apps. If they can tweak their search system a little,
the cream will rise to the top giving users a more relevant search
result. I trust that Google will execute.</p>
