10 Things I've Learned About the Android Market
===============================================

About seven months ago, [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com) decided to
diversify it’s B2C platforms by allocating resources towards the Android
Market. The phones were selling faster than Justin Bieber tickets and
their App Store was just as young. The fact that our Senior Mobile
Programmer (he likes us to call him that), Corey, couldn’t get service
inside of our apartment made the Verizon-Android combo even more
appealing.

Months passed and we finally started the upload process. The one thing
we kept hearing over and over again was that Android users don’t buy
apps. We were freaked. We uploaded our first app a month ago. Here’s
what I’ve learned:

1.  In general, Android apps are twice as spammy and half the quality of
    iPhone apps. In the sports section, we had little competition in
    terms of quality. There were news apps and a few roster apps, but no
    apps that combined all of the features we had. It is obvious that
    mobile developers are still spending a lot of their resources on the
    iPhone and then porting to the android as a secondary platform.
2.  Just like the early days of the App Store, the Android Market has
    massive keyword spamming that goes unchecked. Titles are clean but
    the app descriptions contain keywords that reference other popular
    apps.
3.  There’s also frequent IP rights infringement. I ran across hundreds
    of themed (wallpaper) apps in the sports section. All of them toted
    the official logo of each team. The majority of them were charging
    money. However, if the IP owner contacts Google, they will remove
    the apps. This happened for many of the unofficial NBA apps.
4.  People ARE paying for apps. I saw wallpaper apps that had hundreds
    of sales at \$1. When I saw this, I knew that Android users would
    pay for something that provided utility. Our first upload is at
    almost 100 sales within it’s first month at \$1.99.
5.  You can’t revert to a paid app once you have set your app to free.
    Found this little quark out after it was too late and had to upload
    a newer-versioned apk.
6.  Ranks seem to be based on download rate. I’ve seen apps with a
    smaller base show up before an app that had a huge base. It also may
    have something to do with current installs. Can’t make much of it
    yet.
7.  Once you upload your app, it’s on the Market. No delay or cumbersome
    approval process.
8.  Google displays robust stats. App sales, active downloads, error
    reports, reviews, and comments are updated 2-3 times a day. You can
    view and download all of the Google checkout stats for each of your
    customers for any chosen time period. This includes info like phone
    number, name, state, etc.
9.  There’s a straightforward app uploading process. Self-signing and a
    one-page form make it pretty easy for developers to dive in.
10. Google has a return policy that takes some getting used to. Users
    have 24 hours to cancel any order. These orders are marked as
    Chargeable. If a user doesn’t cancel, the order is charged. We’re
    running at a 19.7% cancel rate. This strategy fits perfectly into
    Google’s open-ecosystem policy. Users have a trial period with an
    app and if they delete it within 24 hours, they’re refunded. This
    truly gives the user the final say in quality control.

Overall, I’m impressed. Google has done a lot with their Android Market.
They stay out of the developer’s way and let customers decide app
quality. They have great reports and give users a grace period to weed
out low-quality apps. If they can tweak their search system a little,
the cream will rise to the top giving users a more relevant search
result. I trust that Google will execute.
