Don't Assume The Negative
=========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l26ub1ihhn1qzbc4f.jpg)

On Saturday night, [Brian and I](http://reflect7.com/about-us) were
talking about how excited we are for [Big
Omaha](http://blog.reflect7.com/2009/05/16/big-omaha-recap/). Brian
mentioned that [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://twitter.com/dhh) wasn’t
going to be a speaker anymore. I was a bit miffed, as I really wanted to
listen to him talk. I instantly opened up Tweetie on my iPhone and
[tweeted](http://twitter.com/jprichardson/status/13655736427) to
[Jeff](http://twitter.com/slobotski) and
[Dusty](http://twitter.com/dustyd) (creators of [Big
Omaha](http://www.bigomaha.com/) and founders of [Silicon Prairie
News](http://www.siliconprairienews.com/)):

”. @dustyd @slobotski what happened to @dhh as a speaker and why didn’t
you announce it?”

Dusty [responded](http://twitter.com/dustyd/status/13656454114):

“@jprichardson @slobotski He had a scheduling conflict come up, and
isn’t able to make it. We announced here:
[http://spne.ws/8FO](http://spne.ws/8FO)”

What’s upsetting to me is that I assumed that they didn’t announce it.
I’ve spoken with Jeff and Dusty on a few occasions and they strike me as
individuals with high integrity. I should have just assumed that they
did announce it and that I missed the announcement.

As the old saying goes, “when you assume, you make an ass out of you and
me.” I think when you assume the negative, you make an ass out of
yourself and only yourself.
