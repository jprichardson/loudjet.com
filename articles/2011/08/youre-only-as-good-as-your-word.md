You're Only as Good As Your Word
================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq6ydie4BY1qzbc4f.jpg)

I say this to my son a lot…

> Son, a man is only as good as his word.

One of my favorite bloggers is Sebastian Marshall. He writes a lot about
self improvement and entrepreneurship. When you read his writings, you
feel a sense of integrity from Sebastian. That’s why when I read one of
his recent posts [Let’s Be Honest About Lying, Shall
We?](http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/lets-be-honest-about-lying-shall-we),
I felt a bit let down.

Sebastian writes:

I think that he’s right on his assertion that a lot of people lie. In my
own anecdotal experience, I’ve found that most people lie and find white
lies acceptable. Because most people do this, does that make it
acceptable? [I realize that Sebastian is not arguing this point. I
wanted YOU to think about it though.]

Sebastian goes on to point to
[study](http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/10/are-you-a-liar.php) that finds
that a lot of people lie, and that these lies aren’t evil vicious lies,
but pro-social lies.

Sebastian then quotes a comment by [Nostradeamons on Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2771878) that’s worth posting
the whole comment:

Sebastian then writes in regard to the commentary:

Sebastian then codifies lying from a societal perspective:

> ​1. Expected and demanded in pro-social situations.

> ​2. Tolerated and understood in adversarial situations.

> ​3. Despised and punished when done maliciously outside of an

Phew, that was a bit long.

My take…

Let’s first address lying from \#3. It is indeed wrong to lie in an
attempt to deceive someone for malicious reasons. I don’t think most
would disagree with this.

How about white lies? Where do they fit? Perhaps they belong under
pro-social situations? Let’s say that you’re running late to work
because you woke up late because you were out partying all night long.
You get to work and your boss asks you why you were late - you respond
that you got a flat tire. Is that wrong? Does society “demand” (as
Sebastian writes) that you do this? 

What about if your friend asks you if you like their [new
haircut](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMOh-cul6M)? Do you tell them
that you do, even if you think that they look like [Nick Nolte after he
got arrested for his
DUI](http://www.google.com/search?pq=nick+nolte+mugshot&hl=en&cp=18&gs_id=2i&xhr=t&q=nick+nolte+mugshot&qe=bmljayBub2x0ZSBtdWdzaG90&qesig=8Nk_xuXkdadtpHdJwb6WdQ&pkc=AFgZ2tlH8HV4kH17yyjvwrpWO1m5d1OIZ89Rc37Enr34eaxuGPv5YNG5Nixqo7PK2q1A-A7duI-rT2j4hUETvfr21yMBo_wqJA&authuser=0&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&biw=1383&bih=713&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi)?
[Pictured above.]

How about in the case of the Nigerian engineer? Should he lie to
potential prospects about being from Nigeria? Sebastian’s response was
that he should. Then Sebastian says that after a working relationship
has developed, you should reveal the truth. Admittedly, I may be an
outlier on this perspective, but I’d consider this wrong. If I were the
client, I’d feel that if the person couldn’t be honest about his
location then perhaps the stigmas about Nigeria are true: maybe they are
all dishonest? At the very least, this thought would be running through
my brain.

See, I think that the Nigerian engineer should start coding like a mad
man. Build up a repository of projects and make a name for himself.
Leave location out of the equation. If asked, be honest about it. Be
honest about your realization of the reputation of the country of
Nigeria, and that you’re trying to be the one who changes people’s
perspective about Nigeria. This engineer would build a lot of
credibility by doing such a thing.

How about the case of the entrepreneur seeking investment? Should he lie
to the potential investor if asked about other interested investors? I’d
say no that he shouldn’t. The entrepreneur should optimistically claim
that he’s trying to seek out interested investors. Hell, reframe the
situation in a positive way!

“Mr. Investor. We are looking to build a relationship with interested
investors. We think that you might be a good fit (Only say this if it’s
true) and would be honored if you’d consider this… blah blah blah.”

Naive of me to think? Maybe. But, I believe that we are to live and
strive to the highest of standards. If you do this, people will take
notice. You’ll earn respect.

In short, I think pro-social lies are wrong, whether they are white lies
or not.

How about adversarial situational lies? This is where I do agree with
Sebastian. Let’s take the classic proposed case of you living in Nazi
Germany. You just happen to be hiding some of your Jewish friends in
your basement. Nazis knock on your door and ask if you’re hiding any
Jews. You can fully anticipate their intent. How do you respond?

Some would say that it’s intrinsically evil and wrong to lie. That you
should be silent, or that you could use wide mental reservation and say
something clever like “they are not at home” - implying the Jews’ home.
To quote the British: bollocks! In this situation, I think that it’s OK
to lie to the Nazis. You are potentially saving the life of your Jewish
friends.

OK, how about cases that don’t have as drastic of consequences?
Sebastian mentions a scenario where maybe you’re traveling and you’re
asked if you’re from around the area. You retort back that you are
because you might question your safety if you respond differently. I
think this perspective is sound.

Let’s codify whether a lie is morally permissible or not. I borrow this
completely from the Catholic Catechism pre 1997 [Catechism changed their
wording after 1997, could change the interpreted outcome]. 

Borrowed from [Eric
Sammons](http://ericsammons.com/blog/2010/03/25/can-we-lie-to-save-lives/):

1.  “Speak or act against the truth”: In other words, the words or
    actions have to be not true.
2.  “In order to lead into error”: A misspoken word or erroneous
    statement said in ignorance is not a lie.
3.  “Someone who as the right to know the truth”

\#3 is the key point in regard to the adversarial situational lies. The
Nazis didn’t need to know whether their were Jews in your home or not,
you knew their intent. Same thing with a shady stranger who might
question you if you travel.

Does this also apply to the interested investor or the Nigerian
engineer? I’m sure some of you would argue that it does. I think that in
those cases, the questioner could arguably have a right to know.

If you want to read a fascinating exchange on the morality of lying, I’d
encourage that you read this
[post](http://newtheologicalmovement.blogspot.com/2011/02/it-is-sin-to-lie-even-to-planned.html).
It’s not his conclusion that is important, a conclusion that I disagree
with, it’s the dialogue between the commenters that can help you to
determine your moral integrity framework for discerning what you find
acceptable to lie about.

In summary, I think that you should avoid lying at most costs.
Especially in the pro-social/white lie situation. Challenge yourself to
be a better person. People will notice your honesty and you will gain
respect. Trust me! :p
