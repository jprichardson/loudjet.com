Bona Fide Everyday Stories
==========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2ajegTitv1qzbc4f.jpg)

What do the following blog posts have in common? 

1.  [Life Is
    Beautiful](http://www.zeldman.com/2010/05/11/life-is-beautiful/)
2.  [The Big Game, Zuckerberg and Overplaying your
    Hand](http://calacanis.com/2010/05/12/the-big-game-zuckerberg-and-overplaying-your-hand/)
3.  [Crucial first hire: the “do-it-all office
    admin”](http://www.currentlyobsessed.com/2009/12/16/crucial-first-hire-the-do-it-all-office-admin/)

The astute reader might point out that they are all popular posts

News](http://news.ycombinator.com); which is true. But they have
something else in common. Have you figured it out yet?

in

This is why these blog posts are successful, they tell a story.

what makes a good story:

Most of all, great stories agree with our world view. The best stories
don’t teach people anything new. Instead, the best stories agree with
what the audience already believes and makes the members of the audience
feel smart and secure when reminded how right they were in the first
place.

Stories comfort us. Stories force us to mentally engage with products.
My favorite story is the Google Superbowl commercial. It’s a romantic
story of a man studying abroad in Paris who meets a French woman. I
won’t ruin it for you, you have to watch it! Here it is:
