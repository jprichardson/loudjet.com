<h1>Steve Jobs Biography: Insanely Great</h1>
<p>My cobbled notes on the Steve Jobs biography…</p>
<p>First, one of my favorite quotes that makes my hair stand up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the
world are the ones who do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book has a few recurring themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Steve Jobs is a dick and seems to be able to exploit others into
doing what he wills. This is both good and bad.</li>
<li>Steve Jobs has a reality distortion field; see #1.</li>
<li>Steve Jobs is meticulous about the design of just about anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>My notes will focus more on Steve Jobs the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The book establishes early on that Steve Jobs has a disdain for
authority. After reading this and some of the anecdotes regarding his
family history, I felt as if Isaacson wrote part of the book for me. It
spoke to me personally. Perhaps, that means it was well written? <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/15/siracusa-jobs-bio">Forget
the
haters</a>.</p>
<p>A quote about religion that resonated with me: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The juice goes out of Christianity when it becomes too based on faith
rather than on living like Jesus or seeing the world as Jesus saw it.
I think different religions are different doors to the same house.
Sometimes, I think the house exists, and sometimes I don’t. It’s a
great mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the early tales of Jobs seeking enlightenment and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_in_Buddhism">prajna</a> - much <a href="http://techneur.com/post/859911519/which-is-better-the-journey-or-the-destination">like
my
journey</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural shock than
going to India. The people in the Indian countryside don’t use their
intellect like we do, they use their intuition instad, and their
intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world.
Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about that statement for a moment; think about how it relates to
products. Of course their are biases, but I think that it could be said
that making a product intuitive or one that appeals to intuition far
outweighs those that appeal to the intellect. People are not rational,
and have different levels of intellect. Products that appeal to
intellect aren’t necessarily bad, see: Vim. They are just niche
products. When a person wants to have an impact upon the world, like
Jobs, this must be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My vision was to create the first fully packaged computer. We were no
longer aiming for the handful of hobbyists who liked to assemble their
own computers, who knew how to buy transformers and keyboards. For
every one of them, there were a thousand people who would want the
machine to be ready to run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markkula (original investor in Apple) wrote a one page paper: “The Apple
Marketing Philosphy”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong>. An intimate connection with the feelings of the customer.
We will truly understand the needs of the customer better than any
other company.\
<strong>Focus</strong>. In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to
do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.\
<strong>Impute</strong>. People form an opinion of a company by the signals that it
conveys. People do judge a book by it’s cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci: “Simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication.” This became one of the maxim’s for Jobs’s design
philosophy.</p>
<p>The Apple II, Lisa, Xerox PARC, and Macintosh stories set the stage for
Job’s core beliefs on products:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design leads engineering. That is to say, the design dictates
everything. Engineering must find a way to make it work with the
design. Most companies are backwards in this regard.</li>
<li>Simple products are easier to use.</li>
<li>Customers don’t know what they want, Apple must show them.</li>
<li>For the best product experience, Apple must own it end-to-end.
Hardware and software in contrast to the PC environment where
Microsoft just owns the operating system.</li>
</ol>
<p>On competition…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steve had a way of motivating by looking at the bigger picture. Jobs
thought of himself as an artist and he encourage others to think this
way too. His goal was never to make a lot of money or to be
competition, it was to do the greatest thing possible or even a little
greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does it feel to you like companies get competition all wrong? They are
so focused on what their competition is doing, instead of just being the
best at what they can be. Companies lose focus by doing this. </p>
<p>The book doesn’t conclude this, but I wonder if part of the reason he
did this was to instill cultural pride in his employees. If they feel
they must focus on these details, then they’ll ingrain this philosophy
in their heads day in and day out. Thus, being a bit more meticulous
about their crafts.</p>
<p>On employees…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned over the years that A-plus players like to work together,
and they don’t like it if you tolerate B work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>Jobs had incessant demands for perfectionism in things that most people
won’t care about. Two examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>The inside of the cases and how Jobs wanted them to look neat and
clean.</li>
<li>The way his factories look and how he detailed he wanted machinery
to look and operate. Even positioning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rebel Spirit…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market Research when asked about launching the Mac…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did Alexander Graham Bell do any market research when inventing the
telephone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Focus…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what do to. That’s
true for companies, and it’s true for products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Design…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up
expressing itself in successive outer layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I felt as if I was taking a tour of
the mind of Steve Jobs and what made him tick.</p>
<p>Now, imagine what a person could do if they could lead in a more humble
manner, giving their employees credit, not stealing the spotlight, but
not being afraid of calling people out on their bullshit and pushing
them to their limits? Imagine if this person had a rebellious attitude
and a disdain for authority. What if this person had an overwhelming
desire to be honest, even at his own expense? Imagine if this person had
a love of simplicity and art. Imagine that this person is driven with a
passion to deliver maximum impact on improving people’s lives. Could
this person change the world? We’ll see.</p>
