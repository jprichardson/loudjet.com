51 Hours to Live
================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhp2kkECxf1qzbc4f.jpg)

Reddit has a section called “[IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/)”
which stands for “I am a… ask my anything.” A person recently posted
that they have [51 hours left to
live](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy6yz/51_hours_left_to_live/).
This person has been sick with cancer for six years; he has decided that
on Tuesday he will end his life in accordance with [Oregon’s Death with
Dignity
Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Death_with_Dignity_Act).

I found the person’s responses fascinating. What I think the important
take away is that life is truly a gift, one that should be cherished. We
as entrepreneurs should read his responses and use them to put
perspective on our own lives.

-   Are we living each day to the fullest? Not wasting a single minute?
-   Are we prioritizing each activity in our life?
-   Are we considering the implications of our actions in regards to our
    business ventures on our family and friends?
-   Are we spending money wisely so that we may have ample amounts for
    what really matters?
-   At our worse business moments, how bad is it really? Do we still
    have our health? Are we going to die in 51 hours?

I challenge you to ask yourself these questions daily.
