<h1>100th Post</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7dtyfIwRA1qzbc4f.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I tweeted out yesterday asking if people blogged everyday or at least
every weekday. I don’t personally know anyone that does. Most people
think that it’s crazy. My business partners even think blogging every
weekday is a waste of time. I’ve wrote about <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/the-best-exercise-any-entrepreneur-can-do">why an entrepreneur should
blog</a>
before. It’s hard. It’s really hard to blog every weekday. Some days I
don’t make it, but I’ve only missed a few. Many of the posts I don’t
think are great, but they’re me. They’re Brian. They’re us. They’re
documents of our journey. Fortunately, we’ve had many posts that are
really popular. Here are the top 5 according to Google Analytics:</p>

<p>This blog has 74 RSS subscribers, a paltry sum to many, but very
meaningful to me. This blog has 25 Tumblr followers. It has had 19,843
unique visitors. This was all accomplished since we made a commitment in
mid-April. If you’re a Tumblr follower or an RSS subscriber, send me an
email [jp@reflect7.com] by no later than Friday, August 18th 10:00 AM
UTC-5 and tell me something about yourself. Tell me about your business
if you have one. Tell me if you’ve been inspired, if not that’s fine
too. I have a no-strings attached gift for you. Don’t worry, you don’t
even have to reside in the US like my previous gifts required. Thank you
for reading about my struggle, my journey, and my accomplishments. I
truly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Many times I want to quit, but I’m fueled by the thought that if one
person gains something from this blog, it will have been worth it - as
I’ll have truly made a mark on this planet and that is my ultimate goal.
I want to change the world.</p>
<p>I want to leave you with this Nike commercial on failure:</p>
<p>Where will I be in 1000 posts? Where will you be?</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
