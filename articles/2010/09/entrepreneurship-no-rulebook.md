Entrepreneurship: No Rulebook
=============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9fxolqB4B1qzbc4f.jpg)

Yesterday, I met with the [guys](http://reflect7.com) at [Dat’s Asian
Cuisine](http://www.google.com/search?q=dat's+asian+lincoln,ne) tonight
for our weekly Monday night meeting. As an aside, Dat’s is an excellent
Asian restaurant that gives you a lot of food for the moola. We’re still
wandering. Still lost. We have anxiety about [Apple’s new iPhone app
approval
rules.](http://techneur.com/post/1095220730/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-and-what-they-mean-to)
My thought is that this is the reality of business. Business and
building new products is risky and risk naturally creates anxiety.

We’re trying to figure out ways to leverage our 150k user base into
additional products. Perhaps something B2B. I hate the fact that our
primary source of income comes from B2C. Even worse, Apple or Google can
cut us at anytime. But again, it’s the reality of our situation. We’re
considering ways to maybe even incorporate game mechanics to keep our
user base engaged. Time will tell.

This is business. This is why entrepreneurship can’t be taught. There is
no rulebook for success. It’s continuous commitment to trying to figure
out what the hell you’re doing day-in and day-out.

I came upon the website for the [Lincoln Public Schools Entrepreneurship
Focus Program](http://eship.lps.org/) which contains a great quote:
