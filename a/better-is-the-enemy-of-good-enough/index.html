<p>About a year and a half ago, I was working on a brochure for my cousin’s
massage clinic. I was decent at Photoshop and Illustrator at the time
and my cousin had a clear mission for his business. In terms of the
project timeline, none of this matter. That little tri-folded piece of
paper took us over 40+ man hours to create. Here’s the sick part… It’s
not even finished.</p>
<p>So what happened? Perfectionism. We were too busy trying to perfect
every message, every graphic, and every design. We were trying to create
a work of art instead of just connecting a piece of the puzzle in the
larger work of art - the massage clinic business. Scott and I lost site
of that and the project never shipped. You can call it feature creep,
mission creep, or just plain creepy. Whatever you call it, trying to go
“Better” can really hurt your project:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Better” breeds ego-involvement. The more you try to perfect
something, the more effort goes into development. With that effort
comes an attachment. I’ve been way over-involved on a few projects
and when I was told that all of my effort wasn’t necessary, I was
practically breathing fire. When developers are too close to their
code, emotions can flare. This hurts the team as much as it does the
project.</li>
<li>“Better” consumes time on something that might not be necessary in
the first place. Look at the brochure example. My cousin’s business
is doing great. He may never even use the brochures. The closer you
get towards perfect, the more time it will consume to make it
marginally better. That extra effort put in doesn’t justify the
extra time spent. When it’s your first few iterations, don’t worry
so much about the details, just get the project out the door.</li>
<li>“Better” stalls customer feedback. Why go great lengths to improve a
feature when customers may end up wanting something entirely
different? Get your basic idea functional and then let your
customer’s decide if it’s good or bad. If they like it, then you can
spend time perfecting it for the next iteration. If they hate it,
then you can start on what they want. Either way, directional
feedback is reached much faster when you ship with “Good Enough.”</li>
<li>Trying to go for “Better” kills momentum. When you hit your goals
and see projects ship, you gain confidence and self-efficacy. You
establish inertia as you move towards a certain direction. To quote
my favorite business book,
<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1864-rework-unveiling-the-cover">Rework</a>: <em>You
can</em>‘t <em>build</em> on top of “We’ll<em>decide</em> later,” but <em>you can
build</em> on top of “<em>Done</em>.”</li>
<li>Perfectionism is toxic towards the team. If one member goes out of
their way to be a perfectionist, then their persnickety qualms may
flow into the entire project. They will say, “Why didn’t you polish
this feature?” or “Why didn’t you finish that entire module?”
because they are used to doing things that way. Let me rephrase
that, they are used to overworking themselves in a blind direction.
If they keep silent, they may resent the rest of the team for their
so-called “Lazyness.” Either way, trying to go “Better” is too
stressful. Why make deadlines harder to hit?</li>
</ol>
<p>So don’t get so crazy about the first bunch of iterations. Think of them
as feedback sensors. Get the feature to “Good Enough” and get the
project out the door.</p>
