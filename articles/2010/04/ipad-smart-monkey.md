If the iPad Is a Big iPod Touch, then People Are Just Smart Monkeys

I do not consider myself an early adopter of gadgets. I waited until the
second generation iPhone before I bought one. Why did I buy the iPad on
day of the launch?

Two reasons:\
1) It’s a new paradigm in computing. Yes, tablet PCs have been out for
over a decade. Apple didn’t bring anything new to the table. Or did
they? You see, all of the previous tablet PCs had an OS that wasn’t
designed for touch. Touch was an afterthought. Since I’m an
entrepreneur, I wanted this device in my life. I wanted to see what
problems it would solve for me. If it solves problems for me, it likely
will solve problems for others.\
\
2) [Reflect7](http://reflect7.com) has developed iPhone software. In
fact, iPhone software has been the source of 100% of our revenue. It
makes sense for us to consider applying our knowledge to the iPad.\
\
How did it benefit me as an entrepreneur?\
\
1) Reading - I love to read… though I don’t read as much books as I
would like. I spend a lot of my time reading reading business and tech
blogs. I want to read more books. I may have 15 to 20 minutes of
down-time a day, time where I’m in an office waiting for someone,
waiting for my son’s sports to end, waiting… waiting… waiting. Now that
I carry my iPad wherever I go, I can read. Ya, I could’ve read books on
my iPhone… but the screen size doesn’t lend itself well to reading.\
\
2) Reading - Did I mention that I love to read? iBooks is an amazing
app. My only complaint is that it doesn’t have annotations. I like that
I can highlight sentences and easily find them later. I like how I can
go back to each book and it opens right where I left off. \
\
3) Miscellaneous Tasks\
    a) Sketching - I’m not the next Picasso. Not even close. I have
trouble with stick figures. Often, I find myself sketching user
interfaces for clients on notepads. Now, I with SketchBook or ArtStudio
I can mock very simple UIs for clients.\
    b) Wolfram Alpha - If you haven’t used Wolfram Alpha yet, you’re
missing out! I love having financial calculators, stock info,
mathematical info, nutritional info, and pretty much everything else you
can think of in one application! Yes, I know there is a [web
app](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). Entrepreneurs need easy access to
information.\
\
Do you need to buy an iPad for your business? No…. you’ll be fine
without one. Should you buy an iPad for your business? Absolutely. This
is a device that you won’t know what it can and will do for you until
you own it. I highly encourage you to read the [Daring
Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad) and [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars)
articles about the details of the iPad and
[Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/150474/2010/04/ipad_not_for_everyone.html?t=)article
about its shortcomings.\
\
You’re probably thinking… “but JP this article sucks, you only mention
some tasks that can still be done on an iPhone!” Did I mention that [I’m
just a Smart
Monkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)?
