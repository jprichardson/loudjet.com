The Two-Device Productivity Solution
====================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lirt0iOoN81qzbc4f.png)

I’m Catholic and ‘tis the season of
[Lent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent). Cue the jokes about fish and
priests. It’s common for Catholics to sacrifice something during the
time of Lent. So when you are
[jonesing](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jonesing) for
a fix of what you sacrificed, you can reflect upon the life of Jesus.
Along with the snooze button, I gave up Reddit and Hacker News.

I spent \*a lot\* of time on these sites. At least one to two hours a
day. Did I come out a better person after looking at these sites? In
mosts cases, I’d say yes. Although, I know that there were a number of
times when I’d click “compile” or “run tests” and if it took more than 5
seconds or so, I’d head over to those sites after I had already visited
them for the day and look for articles to read. Doing this ended up
becoming an excuse to waste time. Hence the need to break my addiction.

After a few days I started to really miss the quality content on Hacker
News. The content that I actually felt that caused me to learn.
Fortunately, Seth Godin wrote an intriguing article titled: [Are You
Making
Something?](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/03/are-you-making-something.html)

TL;DR: We trick ourselves into thinking that browsing the internet is
real work since we often use the computer for real work. Solution: find
another device to do your browsing.

I’ve since done this. I use my iPad for iPhone for Facebook, Hacker
News, CNN, etc. Essentially anything that could be considered
consumption. My laptop is now used for only production and real work.
The only exceptions are research or browsing APIs which constitutes
research.

The image for this blog post is of my hosts file. I have set my favorite
sites to point to localhost so that I can’t access them. This protects
me if I were to slip up. All major operating systems use the same
syntax, use [this Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) to find the location of
your hosts file for your OS so that you can protect you from yourself.

Let me know how this goes for you.
