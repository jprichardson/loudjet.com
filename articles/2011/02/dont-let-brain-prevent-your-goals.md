Don't Let the Brain Prevent You From Your Goals
===============================================

Today is a huge day! New Macbook Pro’s were released! It’s Steve Jobs
Birthday! It’s my five-year anniversary with my fiance! Zomg! To you, my
dear reader, this information may be of little relevance to you. But
what follows is.

This month I’ve set a goal to do
5000 [burpees](http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/27/the-burpee-the-one-exercise-to-rule-them-all/).
For you math wienies, that’s just about 180 burpees a day. A burpee is
an exercise where you quickly drop to the ground like you’re going to do
a pushup and then burst into the air like an excited cheerleader. They
really suck; your legs should feel like battery acid was pumped through
them if you do them quickly enough. I have 810 left.

Last week I was hit with a multitude of unexpected problems related to
my various consulting projects. This last weekend I had to attend a
conference from Friday until Sunday afternoon. Early this week I didn’t
feel the best. My typical routine is to go to the gym every morning and
do 300 burpees along with some weight-lifting. I didn’t go into the gym
at all this week, I thought I’d do more at home if I just focused on
burpees. I overslept today, I haven’t done one burpee yet today.

Do you see what’s happening? My brain is making small excuses as to why
I shouldn’t achieve this goal. The brain wants to be comfortable. It
likes to try to tell you why you shouldn’t do a task that will help you
be successful. Your brain is trying to protect you.

Seth Godin call’s it [the
Resistance](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html):

> The resistance is the voice in the back of our head telling us to back
> off, be careful, go slow, compromise. 

Next time your brain is trying to prevent you from achieving, force
yourself to persevere.
