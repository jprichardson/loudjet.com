<h1>Literature and Life</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljyh2jyLfx1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I love literature. It wasn’t always that way. In fact, before high
school, I hated reading. Something in high school changed. I credit a
lot of it too one of my high school English teachers.</p>
<p>I first met Mr. Hansen when I was a freshman. He just so happened to be
the lineman coach for my high school football team. Mr. Hansen, a portly
man with a bit of a double-chin and a military haircut, had an
irresistible sense of humor. He wasn’t a person that you’d call funny,
but witty. As we pushed the hit sled, the 300 lb bastard would be
standing on the back of the sled, sweating over us, yelling: “MOVE!
MOVE! MOVE! CHOP! CHOP! CHOP!… MOVE YOUR FEET!”</p>
<p>When I walked into his class sophomore year, I figured that he was just
another football coach forced to teach a class that he didn’t have much
passion for. I couldn’t have been more wrong. He used literature to
relay stories and life lessons. I remember him professing that if us
young minds could, we should move across country; we need to get out of
our comfort zone to learn more about ourselves. This has always stuck
with me. I remember the stories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms">A Farewell to
Arms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby">The Great
Gatsby</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/04/19/great.gatsby.mansion.cnn?hpt=C2">I was kinda
bummed that they are [tearing down the
house</a>
that inspired the novel], and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front">All Quiet on the Western
Front</a>.</p>
<p>“Get out of your comfort zone.” This has since stuck with me.</p>
<p>Read this piece: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/19/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything">The Sad Beautiful Fact That We’re All Going to Miss
Amost
Everything</a>
It’s about how so much literature and media is produced that we can’t
consume it all. I’ll highlight the most important points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the world’s books, music, films, television and
art, you will never see. It’s just numbers.</p>
<p>Consider books alone. Let’s say you read two a week, and sometimes you
take on a long one that takes you a whole week. That’s quite a brisk
pace for the average person. That lets you finish, let’s say, 100
books a year. If we assume you start now, and you’re 15, and you are
willing to continue at this pace until you’re 80. That’s 6,500 books,
which really sounds like a lot.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Now, everything gets dropped into our laps, and there are really only
two responses if you want to feel like you’re well-read, or
well-versed in music, or whatever the case may be: culling and
surrender.</p>
<p>Culling is the choosing you do for yourself. It’s the sorting of
what’s worth your time and what’s not worth your time. It’s saying, “I
deem Keeping Up With The Kardashians a poor use of my time, and
therefore, I choose not to watch it.” It’s saying, “I read the last
Jonathan Franzen book and fell asleep six times, so I’m not going to
read this one.”</p>
<p>Surrender, on the other hand, is the realization that you do not have
time for everything that would be worth the time you invested in it if
you had the time, and that this fact doesn’t have to threaten your
sense that you are well-read. Surrender is the moment when you say, “I
bet every single one of those 1,000 books I’m supposed to read before
I die is very, very good, but I cannot read them all, and they will
have to go on the list of things I didn’t get to.”</p>
<p>It is the recognition that well-read is not a destination; there is
nowhere to get to, and if you assume there is somewhere to get to,
you’d have to live a thousand years to even think about getting there,
and by the time you got there, there would be a thousand years to
catch up on.</p>
<p>What I’ve observed in recent years is that many people, in cultural
conversations, are far more interested in culling than in surrender.
And they want to cull as aggressively as they can. After all, you can
eliminate a lot of discernment you’d otherwise have to apply to your
choices of books if you say, “All genre fiction is trash.” You have
just massively reduced your effective surrender load, because you’ve
thrown out so much at once.</p>
<p>The same goes for throwing out foreign films, documentaries, classical
music, fantasy novels, soap operas, humor, or westerns. I see people
culling by category, broadly and aggressively: television is not
important, popular fiction is not important, blockbuster movies are
not important. Don’t talk about rap; it’s not important. Don’t talk
about anyone famous; it isn’t important. And by the way, don’t tell me
it is important, because that would mean I’m ignoring something
important, and that’s … uncomfortable. That’s surrender.</p>
<p>It’s an effort, I think, to make the world smaller and easier to
manage, to make the awareness of what we’re missing less painful.
There are people who choose not to watch television – and plenty of
people don’t, and good for them – who find it easier to declare that
they don’t watch television because there is no good television (which
is culling) than to say they choose to do other things, but
acknowledge that they’re missing out on Mad Men (which is surrender).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do indeed surrender. I’ve heard that Mad Men is a great show. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2bLNkCqpuY">This
clip</a> alone makes me want to
watch the show. In short, the main character is pitching a marketing
campaign to Kodak for their product that they called “The Wheel”; the
main character redefines “The Wheel” as the “The Carousel” as he shows
pictures of his family and how the “The Carousel” is like a time-machine
that allows us to go forward or go back to relive our memories and to
take us home again where we long to be. The clip is very moving and
powerful. So, yeah, I’d like to watch Mad Men someday.</p>
<p>I miss fiction. I miss a lot of it. As I said, I surrender. Maybe
watching TV isn’t a waste of time. Maybe reading fiction isn’t a waste
of time.</p>
<p>It’d be a bit naive to believe that by only focusing on our businesses
and things related to our business, it’ll make us better entrepreneurs.
Really, it’s our life experiences and our reactions that help to define
who we are, and perhaps, help to govern our decisions and actions. Don’t
you think?</p>
