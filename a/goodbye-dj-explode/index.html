<h1>Goodbye DJ Explode</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7bqteYjh31qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="http://reflect7.com/about-us">three of us</a> were lounging out by the
pool on Saturday afternoon discussing business and our need to figure
something out. You see, we are having trouble keeping a focus. We’ve got
multiple consulting projects on our plate and we have multiple products
that we’re working on as well. Two of them being DJ Explode and the
Sports Fan Apps.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we leave town to go to a nearby city to get away from
distractions. This allows us to focus on the strategy of Reflect7. We
ended up choosing Omaha. During dinner, we decided that it would be best
if we killed DJ Explode.</p>
<p>What was my major struggle was that the Sports Fan Apps are making us
money but yet we are not focusing much on them. Also, we tend to drop
projects a lot without finishing them. So I was leaning towards pushing
the release of DJ Explode for the sake of finishing.</p>
<p><strong>What was DJ Explode?</strong>\
DJ Explode was an iPhone app that would allow users to share their
playlists. Before we started development, we all agreed that it was a
pain in the ass to make playlists. So, we thought it would be cool if we
had an app that allowed users to share playlists.</p>
<p><strong>Why did we kill it?</strong>\
We killed it for a number of reasons. First, we knew that in order to
build it correctly, we would have to allow users to connect with their
friends on Facebook. We would have to build a large social component.
Building social interactions in apps takes a lot of time. DJ Explode
would have taken at least six months to a year to get it to that point.
We also considered that our Sports Fan Apps have over 100k downloads. It
would be wise for us to leverage this user base into more profit before
moving on to other projects.</p>
<p>DJ Explode is dead. Does it seem like it would have solved your problem?</p>
