<h1>Focus On Your Customers and the Money Will Follow</h1>

<p>On Reddit, someone posted about how he wrote to a company named
<a href="http://www.mizage.com/">Mizage</a> to ask for a discount on their \$14
software. They wrote back and said he could just have it for free. They
just asked that he would tell his friends about the software. The guy
ended up buying it anyway and then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ckcbr/mizage_a_small_development_company_that_made/">posting on
Reddit</a>.
Here’s the transcript:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rejpI.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why does this work? Because it’s so fucking rare for companies to do
this. As customers this kind of treatment typically blows our minds.
Doing this sort of thing has worked in our favor many times. We receive
emails all of the time about getting apps for free (these cost \$1). We
gladly oblige. We typically just ask that these people tell their
friends. In many cases we give them additional promo codes. Sometimes
these people will go post on forums and word spreads within their
respective communities. Here’s an example of a South Florida Bull’s fan
who posted on a
forum: <a href="http://thebullspen.com/index.php?topic=66140.0"></a><a href="http://thebullspen.com/index.php?topic=66140.0"><a href="http://thebullspen.com/index.php?topic=66140.0">http://thebullspen.com/index.php?topic=66140.0</a></a>.
During that day we got about 35 downloads. Overall, we’ve had thousands.
This has happened time &amp; time again.</p>
<p>I’m not telling you this to toot our horn. I’m just trying to
demonstrate that this treatment works. Hell, consider
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/delivering-happiness-review">Zappos</a>.
They give customers free overnight shipping and other crazy stuff such
as putting balloons in packages.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. You can’t do this without being 100% altruistic
about it. These must be seen as gifts without expecting anything in
return. Customers are excellent at sniffing out bullshit. You must
be genuine about this and completely self-giving.</p>
<p>Do this and you win.</p>
