Don't Listen to the Techies, Embrace Chrome OS
==============================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldj6afUjjc1qzbc4f.png)

When I first heard about Chrome OS, I was ecstatic. I love the idea of
being able to run my apps in the cloud and have them seamlessly sync
with my data without thought. I realize the current practical
limitations, especially for developers. But for the average person that
just wants to surf and write a few papers, would Chrome OS suffice? I
think so. It’s amazing how many times techies will dismiss current
technology trends as solutions in search of a problem. Case in point: as
you probably know, [Cr48
laptops](http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html) were
just released to testers. Some [Slashdot
commenters](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/12/16/0412220/Gmail-Creator-Says-Chrome-OS-Is-As-Good-As-Dead)
have made statements dismissing the utility of such a laptop.

This sentiment isn’t just isolated to Slashdot either. You can find it
on
[MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/143976/2009/11/chromeos_editorial.html),
[BetaNews](http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/Who-really-needs-a-Chrome-OS-laptop/1292189689),
and
[ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/12/thoughts-on-the-chrome-store-does-the-web-need-an-app-delivery-channel.ars).
This is not the first time that techies have lambasted up and coming
technology or recently released technology. Consider Rob Malda’s
(founder of Slashdot) [comment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Malda)
when the iPod came out: “No wireless, less space than a nomad, lame.”
The iPad was criticized as being just a big iPod Touch. Back, in June [I
wrote a piece on Steve Jobs being a
visionary](http://loudjet.com/a/steve-jobs-henry-ford)
similar to that of Henry Ford. I used the iPhone 4 as an example. I
submitted this piece to Reddit and it was criticized.

I’m convinced that you should ignore the techie while building your
business. Unless of course, the techie is your customer.

What do you think of Chrome OS? What do you think of techies’ assessment
of the success of technology?
