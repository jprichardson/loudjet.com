One of my favorite Bitcoin articles was written by [Erik Voorhees][erik] (the operator of [Satoshi Dice][satoshi]) entitled "[Bitcoin - The Libertarian Introduction][bitcoinlib]". It's well worth the read and makes you really consider the value of Bitcoin. No other article, video, talk has made me think about Bitcoin in such a positive manner until now.
