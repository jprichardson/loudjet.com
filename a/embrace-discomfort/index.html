<h1>Embrace Discomfort</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3ql1rqgUv1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Often times, recurring themes and phrases are narrated to myself in my
head. In college it was “<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/how-bad-do-you-want-it">How bad do you want
it?</a>” It’s as
if the voice in our head is our narrator and can encourage to act in
positive manners or negative manners. My narrator is overwhelming
positive, and for that, I’m very thankful.</p>
<p>The most recent phrase that I keep repeating is “embrace discomfort.” My
narrator is telling me that if I’m comfortable that perhaps I’m not
growing. But think about this for a bit, what are some of your most
valuable achievements? I’ll bet you weren’t comfortable on your path to
those achievements. I bet you had to work your ass off. I know that I
did. Graduating college with two engineering degrees while being a
single father sucked. Giving a best man speech to a room of 400 people
felt like I was going to the firing squad. Running a half-marathon felt
like my legs were going to collapse.</p>
<p>But you know what? My engineering degrees helped form the basis of what
it means to be an engineer and what it takes to think like an engineer.
My best man speech brought the room to hysterical laughter; I received
many compliments that it was one of the best best man speeches that many
have heard. Running the half-marathon has kicked me into running routine
where I now run 15-20 miles a week. All of these things took work. A
shit ton of work. But it was all worth it!</p>
<p>Embracing comfort isn’t just about big accomplishments. It could simply
mean that the next time that you’re at the mall and you see a person
that you know, don’t avoid them, engage them into a conversation. It
could mean that you may actually have to pick up the phone and do cold
call to a potential prospect. It might just be admitting to someone that
you care about that you’re wrong and that you’re sorry. Embracing
discomfort is all about forcing yourself to grow.</p>
<p>I really like what Jonathan of Illuminated Mind
<a href="http://www.illuminatedmind.net/2009/10/01/your-comfort-is-not-important/">writes</a>
about settling and being comfortable:</p>
<p>The main reason you settle is because the unknown is not an agreeable
place to reside; you can’t predict what will happen. But most of all,
you settle to protect your ego.\
\
 That’s because your ego doesn’t like it when you can’t predict the
future. It doesn’t like knowing that your choice — the one that will
really make you feel content — may end up failing. When your ego can’t
predict the outcome, it goes into survival mode. It’s easier to take the
safe, predictable path.\
\
 But we all know deep down that survival is a temporary bet, anyway.
Security does not exist in reality.</p>
<p>That’s what this is all about. Ego. Your ego wants to protect you and
prevent you from failure. It’s your biological <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html">lizard
brain</a>
that causes this instinct. Tell your ego to shut up and embrace
discomfort. </p>
