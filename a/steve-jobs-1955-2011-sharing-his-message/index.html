<h1>Steve Jobs 1955-2011: Sharing His Message</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsnf6phqdf1qzbc4f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I pulled into the driveway after I had just picked up my son Chris from
CCD. I told him that Steve Jobs had died. “Who is that?” he said. I was
a bit surprised that he didn’t know who he was; other than Jesus, Steve
Jobs has been one the most influential persons in my life. [Yes, I may
have subtly compared Steve Jobs to Jesus :p]. I wanted to share a few of
his quotes with Chris.</p>
<p>The first are from his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">Stanford commencement
speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not
to follow your heart.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want
to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No
one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is
very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change
agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the
new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually
become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is
quite true.</p>
<p>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other
people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly
want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an important thought to keep in mind as much as possible. We
will all die. When faced with death, we forget the minutia of life but
remember what is important. This should be done daily.</p>
<p>As I tucked Chris into bed, I said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who are crazy enough to believe that they can change the world
are the ones that actually do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote came from an <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/steve-jobs-lesson-on-marketing-values-and-belief">old Steve Jobs
presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Much has been said about how we probably heard the news about<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/05/president-obama-passing-steve-jobs-he-changed-way-each-us-sees-world">Steve
Jobs’s death via his
products</a>.
But consider this, Steve has given us wonderful products, wonderful
products that we use to improve our lives. Now, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/10/a-eulogy-of-action.html">what will you do with
these
products</a>
to make a difference in the lives of others and to maybe even change the
world?</p>
