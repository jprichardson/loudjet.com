<h1>Discipline Is the Strength to Do Things that Will Make Our Future Selves Proud</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7sjjfT3cj1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve written before how I’ll repeat phrases in my head in an attempt to
motivate myself to success. My first one was: “<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/how-bad-do-you-want-it">How Bad Do You Want
It</a>?” I
repeated this over and over as I was working on my dual-engineering
degrees. Lately I’ve been repeating “<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/embrace-discomfort">Embrace
Discomfort</a>.” I
do this to force myself into situations where I might be uncomfortable.
I know that if I put myself in an uncomfortable situation and embrace
it, I’ll grow.</p>
<p>My most recent is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipline is the strength to do the things that will make our future
selves proud, instead of vaguely ashamed. - coderoom.wordpress.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote came from what I would consider to be one of the <a href="http://coderoom.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/discipline-be-the-machine/">best blogs
posts</a>
that I’ve read this year. Seriously.</p>
<p>The author writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipline isn’t single-mindedness – it doesn’t mean forcing ourselves
to sit there, banging our heads against the keyboard until something
breaks. It’s about taking the easy option off the table: yes, I want
to give up and read Reddit. Just for a minute or two. Just to relax
and recharge, then I’ll be able to focus so much better…</p>
<p>No. Recognize these desires? Pleasant, tempting, but useless. They
don’t bringing us any closer to achieving our goal, so screw them.
Once the easy, useless options are gone, what can we do to make some
kind of progress? There are lots of different ways to make progress
even when we feel all concentrated-out. Sketch out an understanding of
the system on a piece of paper, away from the screen. Take the classic
short walk; something that actually clears the head and refreshes as
opposed to just being a pleasant distraction from the guilt of not
working. There are many ways to keep on pushing forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Remove the easy option off of the table. Don’t believe that you
can take a short break browsing something and then come back in a few
minutes to work. I’ve been guilty of this so many times. Many times when
I’m waiting for a compile to finish, I’ve been guilty of firing up
Hacker News or some other site thinking that I’ll only be a minute. 45
minutes passes. This has happened way too much. I even built a tool to
measure my <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/less-consumption-more-production">consumption vs
production</a>.
It works.</p>
<p>Read the article. Take the easy option off the table. Don’t take breaks
to read other sites. Be a machine. Build products one by one - and you
will win.</p>
<p>If a Buddhist monk can set himself on fire and be disciplined enough not
to move, you can be disciplined enough to avoid distractions to actually
get work done.</p>
