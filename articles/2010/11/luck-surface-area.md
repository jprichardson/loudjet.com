Luck Surface Area
=================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbkjlgL0FS1qzbc4f.jpg)

As I’ve stated before, I don’t believe in “luck” however, I do believe
in the following quote:

> Luck is what happens when opportunity means preparation. - Seneca
> (Roman Philosopher)

I came across the concept of “Luck Surface Area” over the weekend that I
wanted to share with you. It’s a term coined by [Jason
Roberts](http://www.codusoperandi.com/). Lance of
[page99test.com](http://page99test.com) does a great job [summarizing
the
concept](http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/):

> Jason believes that by putting yourself out there… blogging,
> podcasting, commenting in online discussions, and following up with
> every customer and user, you increase the likelihood of having a
> serendipitous moment. It’s a fun concept to consider – but perhaps
> less of a scientific occurrence than yet another example of the Law of
> Averages.

I may disagree with the concept being an example of the [Law of
Averages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_averages), but I do
strongly agree that by continuously putting yourself out there and
creating content, you will increase your chances of success. Logically,
I think that’s hard to argue with. It makes sense. The more content that
you create, the more positive customer interactions that you have, you
increase the likelihood of someone sharing your story, your content, or
your products. In any case, it’s a win for you.
