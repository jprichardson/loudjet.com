Your Call Is Important To Us
============================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6bgzlvzlx1qzbc4f.jpg)Today I opened
my Time Warner Roadrunner Bill to find that my monthly subscription rate
had almost doubled to \$52.95. Internet porn just got a lot more
expensive…

I was dismayed about the inflated charge and immediately called the
printed phone number. I patiently waited for the automated voice menu to
list the operator option. None came. I repeated the options and listened
very carefully. Still, no operator number was given. So I did what
everyone does - hit zero. The response: “The number you have chosen is
not a valid option. Please listen to the option list and try again.” I
thought, yeah right, I’m not about to waist another five minutes, so I
hit zero. Again, I got the automated response that zero was not a valid
option.

This type of system is poor customer management. Why obfuscate a
real-life service representative? I only interact with a Time Warner rep
about once a year. Usually, that interaction occurs if my service is
bad. You’d think they’d want to talk to me to see how things are going.
This is Time Warner’s chance to
[WOW](http://loudjet.com/a/delivering-happiness-review "Techneur: Delivering Happiness Review")
me back into their arms with a great personal touch. This is their
opportunity to establish a personal connection with me, rather than pawn
me off to an automated system.

Let’s run through the emotions of an average customer scenario here. Bob
is frustrated because he is experiencing poor service from Time Warner
Cable and needs to speak with a representative. Once he calls, Bob must
listen through a batch of irrelevant choices. This makes Bob even more
frustrated. The option for an operator is never given so he gets
angrier. After listening through the options again, Bob punches the zero
key several times and is finally redirected to a live operator. The
first line Bob hears out of their voice is, “Thanks for calling Time
Warner Cable, where we value you as a customer, how can I help you
today?” Bob is seething now. If they valued him so much, then why did
they make him jump through hoops to reach them?

Bob’s anger level went from a 3 to a 6 in a short period of time.
Companies wonder why their reps get treated so harshly by incoming
callers. How many customers has Time Warner lost because a callers level
of frustration was escalated by the call-in process itself? Asking for
help is supposed to be easy and alleviate pain.

Here’s an idea: display a direct line to live representatives right
below the automated one and let your customers sort their needs. There’s
no way in hell I would call if I needed a billing invoice. I can go on
the web and check that in a minute. But my dad can’t - he’s not computer
literate. He would want to call and speak with a live person. Companies
should heed differentiations in comfort level.

By interacting with my dad, Time Warner could have turned his negative
experience into a positive one. That’s a powerful interaction. Actually,
it’s probably one of the most influential ways to act with a person (or
customer), period. People won’t remember your name, your personal
details, or even what you’ve done. What people will remember is how you
made them feel. Here, Time Warner has an opportunity to turn the tide on
someone’s feelings and create an everlasting experience for them.
Otherwise, they’re just a commodity - a service provider at a certain
price point that invokes no loyalty. 

Luckily, I had a great rep that was able to WOW me even after I was
ramped up to a 6. If I would have had an average rep, I wouldn’t have
thought twice about switching to Windstream.

So to all of the Time Warners out there, reallocate some your marketing
resources back into your call centers. Those centers are part of your
marketing whether you realize it or not. Make them easily available so
customers can establish a personal connection with you. A connection
that invokes loyalty over a pricing sheet. This way you won’t be lying
when you say, “Your call is important to us.”
