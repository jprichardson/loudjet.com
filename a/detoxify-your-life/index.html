<h1>Detoxify Your Life</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1txaltNId1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I recently wrote “<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/we-have-a-duty">We Have A
Duty</a>”, but I only
asked you to join me and didn’t provide ideas for us to accomplish
our <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/29/billionaire-charitable-donations-pf-phil_cz_dp_1129billionairephilanthrophy.html">goal</a>.</p>
<p>Let me start with a story. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt
Vonnegut</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Heller">Joseph
Heller</a> were at a cocktail
party hosted by a wealthy billionaire. Vonnegut said to Heller “Joe, how
does it make you feel that our host yesterday may have made more money
than your novel ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">Catch-22</a>’ has
earned in its entire history?” Heller responded “I have something that
he’ll never have. I have enough.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sivers.org/enough">You have enough</a>. What does “Detoxify Your
Life” mean? It means three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend less than you earn.</li>
<li>Remove desire for material goods.</li>
<li>Remove physical clutter from your life.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is that by doing these three things, you’ll eventually be
content with what you have. If you are content with you have, you will
naturally spend less, as you won’t desire more. As an ancillary benefit,
being content with what you have is one of the keys to happiness.</p>
<p>Don’t take it from me though, Mark Cuban wrote a post titled “<a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/04/how-to-get-rich/">How To
Get Rich</a>”. Mark
wrote:</p>
<p>So what should you do to get rich ?\
\
Save your money. Save as much money as you possibly can. Every penny you
can. Instead of coffee, drink water. Instead of going to McDonalds, eat
Mac and Cheese. Cut up your credit cards. If you use a credit card, you
dont want to be rich. The first step to getting rich, requires
discipline. If you really want to be rich, you need to find the
discipline, can you ?\
\
If you can, you will quickly find that the greatest rate of return you
will earn is on your own personal spending. Being a smart shopper is the
first step to getting rich. Yeah you have to give things up and that
doesn’t work for everyone, particularly if you have a family. That is
reality. But whatever you can save, save it. As much as you possibly
can. Then put it in 6 month CDs in the bank.\
\
The first step to getting rich is having cash available. You arent
saving for retirement. You are saving for the moment you need cash. Buy
and hold is a suckers game for you. This market is a perfect example.
Right at the very moment when cash creates unbelievable opportunity,
those who followed the buy and hold strategy have no cash. they cant or
wont sell into markets this low, that kills the entire point of buy and
hold. Those who have put their money in CDs sleep well at night and
definitely have more money today than they did yesterday. And because
they are smart, disciplined shoppers, their personal rate of inflation
is within their means. Cash is king for those wanting to get rich.\
\</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/we-have-a-duty">We Have A
Duty</a>”, I also
wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie">Andrew
Carnegie’s</a> three tenets.
They shouldn’t be practiced linearly. Learn, earn, and give now. This is
also what “Detoxify Your Life” is about. Go around your house, and
gather up stuff that you haven’t used in awhile. If you have old clothes
in your closet that you haven’t worn in six months, box them up. That
George Foreman Grill that you never use, box that up too. Those running
shoes, ya, those need to go to. Either run, or get rid of them. Anything
in your house that you can live without and you don’t use, box them up.
Take these boxes to charity. You are now making a difference. Plus,
you’ll have more room in your house. You’ll have less clutter. Less
things to maintain. Less things that could possibly rob your thoughts
when you could think about more important things. If someone asks you
what you want for your birthday, I highly encourage you NOT to ask for
any physical item. Ask for a gift card, cash, or a donation to charity
in your name. This way you can prevent more material things from
entering you life.</p>
<p>I realize this all very difficult. At least it was for me. Change won’t
happen over night. It may be very difficult to get rid of stuff in your
house. I’ve been practicing these three things for about two years now.
I’ve finally paid off my credit card debt. This has all been tough, but
very worth it. When it comes down to it, <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/78887853/legacy-is-greater-than-currency">legacy is greater than
currency</a>.</p>
<p>If you can start by practicing these three things, we can achieve our
long term goal. We can change the world.</p>
