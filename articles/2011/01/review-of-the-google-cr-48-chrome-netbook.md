Review of the Google Cr-48 Chrome Netbook
=========================================

I really wanted a netbook to keep in my car so that I could blog on the
go. I own an iPad, but the iPad is awful for a productivity device. So,
I ordered an Asus Eee PC.

About a month ago I saw there was a brown package on my doorstep. I was
excited! I swiftly put the box on the hood of my car and tore into it.
It wasn’t my Asus Eee PC, Google had sent me a [Cr-48
laptop](http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html)! I
didn’t think that I would get one when I signed up for the pilot
program.

There are a lot of

[Cr-48](http://gizmodo.com/5710532/an-hour-with-the-google-cr+48-chrome-netbook),
so I’ll be brief.

What I like:

1.  It focuses on one thing, and does it well: web browsing. The
    laptop’s software is literally just a web browser.
2.  Battery life. I can pull 7+ hours on this thing.
3.  Bootup takes a few seconds. Resume from sleep is even less.
4.  The rubbery feel. The whole laptop feels like it’s encased in a
    durable rubber texture.
5.  Built-in Verizon 3G card with 100 MB of data free each month. You
    can upgrade and pay if you want more data.

What I don’t like:

1.  The trackpad. It’s as if they were trying to build an Apple trackpad
    but failed miserably. It’s overly sensitive and sometimes locks into
    a scroll mode.
2.  The power adapter doesn’t use a magnet. It’d be really easy to break
    it off from where it connects to the laptop. I’m not sure why
    manufacturers of laptops don’t incorporate the [Magsafe
    magnets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) into their designs. 

I love this thing for blogging! I highly recommend that if you have the
opportunity to get one, you should. I’d say that this thing represents
what a netbook should be.

Do you have a Cr-48 netbook? What do you think about it?
