Forget the Shiny Tech, Focus on the Customer Experience
=======================================================

I’m always amazed when I discover a new piece of technology or software. Usually, thousands of business ideas start pouring into my head on how I can build a cool product. Most recently, the thought of [Twilio][1], [Mailgun][2], and [Sendgrid][3] came to mind. 

An internal dialogue raged on in my mind:


> “SMS and email are some of the most ubiquitous communication tools, not to mention very pervasive.”

>  ”What could I build quickly to monetize and spread virally?”

> “Focus, you fool…”

> “You’re in the process of selling [one company](http://reflect7.com) and you just [started another](http://gitpilot.com). Plus, no one really cares about how you’re using cool tech.”


And then I dropped the thought.

This has happened to me time and time again. In fact, that’s how Reflect7 was founded. I knew the iPhone would be hot. I knew that consumers would purchase them by the ton. I just didn’t know what apps to develop for it yet. Eventually we settled on sports’ apps, but we didn’t consider the customer experience until the end.

I finally had this realization of all of this when I stumbled upon this video:

It was Steve Jobs who made it crystal clear as to what I had done. I was thinking a lot about the technology and how I could sell that, rather than consider customer problems and how I could build products that delivered a superb experience. This is what [Gitpilot](http://gitpilot.com) will do.
