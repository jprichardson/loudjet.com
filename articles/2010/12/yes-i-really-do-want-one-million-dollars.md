Yes, I Really Do Want One Million Dollars
=========================================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lducpwx5gX1qzbc4f.jpg)

….actually more like ***five*** million dollars.

This is in response to this article: [You Really Don’t Want a Million
Dollars](http://ryanwaggoner.com/2010/12/you-dont-really-want-a-million-dollars/)

I **don’t** want five million dollars so that:

1.  I can buy a nice Ferrari, Masserati, etc.
2.  I can buy a nice mansion with an indoor pool.
3.  I can buy my fiancee 10 carat ring.
4.  I can pay for my son to go to any ivy league school.

No, no… that’s stuff that I don’t want. Don’t get me wrong, some of it
would be nice, but entirely unnecessary.

I **do** want five million dollars so that:

1.  If my son or fiancee get a life-threatening illness, I can stop
    working to spend time with them and know that they’ll still get the
    best treatment that money can buy. In short, it acts as insurance.
2.  I can influence positive change quicker and deliver more of an
    impact. Money acts as leverage. With a lot money, I could
    potentially improve more lives in the world today.

That’s about it. I want insurance and leverage. So, why ***five***
million? At a conservative interest rate of 3% per year, I would net
150k. That’s enough for a family to live on for quite some time. If I
had to spend one million or two for health costs or charitable givings,
it still wouldn’t impact my standard of living too much.

Currently, I make enough money where I don’t have to worry too much.
That’s really all I need. I make a pittance compared to a software
engineer in California, but for Nebraska I make enough.

So for now, I’m focused on doing the best job that I can do each day and
before I can improve the lives of people all over world, I must start
with the people around me. I’ll end with some quotes:

> If you can’t feed 100 people, just feed one. -Mother Teresa

and…

> The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in
> developing the capacity to enjoy less. - Socrates
