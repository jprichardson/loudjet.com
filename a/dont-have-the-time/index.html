<h1>It&#39;s Not About Time, It&#39;s About Priority</h1>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l15xid8agu1qzbc4f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>How often do you think in a day that you don’t have enough time to play
with your child? That you don’t have enough time to spend with your
wife? That you don’t have enough time to start exercising? To start
eating better? To join a social club? I’ll bet at least once a day you
have a similar thought. If only you had the time.</p>
<p>What you are really saying or thinking is that it’s not a priority. You
can’t make the activity a priority. Cut the crap. Don’t ever say “I
don’t have the time.” Own up to what you are really thinking. You don’t
want to make it a priority. That’s all it is. <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/171450360/product-and-brandyour-time">Time is really the only
scarcity
left</a>.</p>
<p>I really like what Pick The Brain <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/time-is-all-we-have-3-ways-to-increase-return-on-investment/">writes on this
topic</a>:</p>
<p>In many ways time is more valuable than money. You’ll always have the
opportunity to make more money, but once time has been spent it’s gone
forever. When you think of time as a commodity, and all of your actions
as investments, it changes the way you approach every day decisions.</p>
<p>So the next time someone wants you to do something, either do it or
respond that it’s not a priority at this moment in your life. Doing this
will force you to consider that the way you spend your time is an
investment in the future. Time truly is a commodity. After all, we all
have only 24 hours a day.</p>
