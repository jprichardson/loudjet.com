<h1>A Crappy Vision Is Better Than Lack of Vision</h1>

<p><a href="http://loudjet.com/a/which-is-better-the-journey-or-the-destination">Yesterday</a>,
I wrote about how I felt like Captain Jack Sparrow in search of a boat.
Well, that’s not entirely true. We have a boat, the boat just happens to
be a row boat. But like Jack, we also have a broken compass. However, I
think this is all pretty normal for a startup that has only been around
for 1.5 years. I’ve read
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/overnight-success-it-takes-years.html">time</a>
and
<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1624-overnight-success-takes-years">time</a>
again that startup <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/patience-success-takes-years">success takes
years</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/iphone-company-struggle-2">March
Madness</a>,
we were just kind of drifting with no vision. Maybe we were jaded by
our <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/iphone-company-struggle-1">optimistic expectations</a>.
I’m not sure. But we took time off of the Sports Fan Apps. Around the
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/big-omaha-2010">Big Omaha
Conference</a>, we
developed the idea for
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/announcing-mindspread">Mindspread</a>.
We got pretty jazzed up about that but then realized we started getting
a number of emails to update our football apps. We <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/learning-pains">lost
passion</a> for the
football apps and weren’t sure what to do. We finally decided upon the
strategy of making enough money so that it gives us the freedom to
choose what we want to do. This includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consult. We currently consult with a few clients on a diverse range
of products. This helps us to sharpen both our technical and our
business skills.</li>
<li>DJ Explode. This is a soon to be released iPhone app that may open
the door for alternative revenue streams.</li>
<li>Sports Fan Apps. These pay the bills. In fact, these make us enough
money that one of us could take a full-time salary on these alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not in love with this vision. In fact, I think that we can do
better. I think that the context switching between projects can be
detrimental. I also believe that it spreads our resources too thin. It
doesn’t allow us to focus our expertise on making one kick ass product
that truly changes the world. However, we are learning a lot, we are
having fun, and we are making money. We will get to our destination,
it’s not a matter of ‘if’, it’s a matter of ‘when.’ </p>
<p>But the message is simple. You must have a vision. You must execute upon
this vision, even if the vision sucks. If you’re not doing anything,
you’re not learning or growing. That’s worse than not being focused and
having a meaningful purpose.</p>
