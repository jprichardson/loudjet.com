Why Are So Many Logos Blue?
===========================

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfawuqF1gE1qzbc4f.jpg)

I was reading Techcrunch this morning about [top-paid iPhone and iPad
apps](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/19/iphone-ipad-top-app-downloads/).
Someone made this
[comment](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/19/iphone-ipad-top-app-downloads/#comment-131245442):

> Conclusion: if your app doesn’t have a blue icon, there’s no chance
> you’ll be in the all time top-ten one day

Scrolling back up and looking at the photo of the apps, the comment is
dead-on.

This got me thinking about business logos in general. A lot of [Fortune
500 company logos really are
blue](http://www.listphile.com/Fortune_500_Logos). But why? According to
the Wikipedia article on [logo
design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo):

> Color is considered important to brand recognition, but it should not
> be an integral component to the logo design, which could conflict with
> its functionality. Some colors are formed/associated with certain
> emotions that the designer wants to convey. For instance loud primary
> colors, such as red, are meant to attract the attention of drivers on
> highways are appropriate for companies that require such attention. In
> the United States red, white, and blue are often used in logos for
> companies that want to project patriotic feelings. Green is often
> associated with the health and hygiene sector, and light blue or
> silver is often used to reflect diet foods. For other brands, more
> subdued tones and lower saturation can communicate reliability,
> quality, relaxation, or other traits.

So, companies in the United States use blue because they want to project
feelings of patriotism? Hmm. According to an [article on
inspiredology.com](http://inspiredology.com/15-blue-logos-that-evoke-precision/):

> The color blue is considered to be nonthreatening yet instill
> confidence. In addition, it’s a traditionally masculine color, so it’s
> no surprise that it also evokes ties to the corporate world. In

> those technologies that use blue in their logos? It’s no coincidence –
> blue is said to conjure thoughts of precision and intellect. Blue is
> also considered to symbolize justice, loyalty and perseverance – one
> of the reasons the American flag is believed to include that color.
> Take a look at these 15 blue-heavy logos and decide if the color makes

So blue is considered to be a masculine color, nonthreatening, and
inspire confidence. But wait… the American flag is said to use blue
because it symbolizes justice, loyalty, and perseverance? Interesting.

A guy at The Natural Sapphire Company [says that blue is associated with
trust and
security](http://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/Blog/whats-in-a-blue-logo).
But he’s biased as he sells [blue
rocks](http://www.google.com/images?q=sapphire)!

[Facebook’s logo and design is
blue](http://www.quora.com/Facebook-1/Why-is-Facebooks-logo-blue)
because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind, so no conspiracy there.

Ahhh… finally a [Quora
thread](http://www.quora.com/Why-is-blue-such-a-popular-color-for-designs-and-logos)
with some answers! Responders state that:

1.  Humans have evolved to see red and green effectively, red and
    yellows can be signals of danger. Stop lights? Therefore, we notice
    blue more often out of the corner of our eye. I’m not sure I buy
    this response. If we can see red/greens so effectively and
    red/yellows are signals of dangers, you would think that colors that
    we notice should be signals of danger. Personally, I don’t think I
    notice blue more than the other colors.
2.  Others use blue, so thats why so many companies use blue. This
    answer is a bit unsatisfying, but could be true.
3.  Blue is a majority of people’s favorite color. Backed with sources:
    [1](http://awp.diaart.org/km/usa/survey.html)
    [2](http://www.pollwizard.com/29)
    [3](http://webdesign.about.com/gi/pages/poll.htm?linkback=http://webdesign.about.com/b/a/255988.htm&poll_id=3387482002&poll=5&submit1=Submit%20Vote)
    [4](http://www.krstarica.com/eng/poll/index.php?anketa=285) But why
    is blue so many people’s favorite color?
4.  Psychologically it’s calming and inoffensive. But what makes it
    calming and inoffensive?
5.  Blue hue offers more diversity changes. 

So many different answers and reasons. Why doesn’t anyone mention that
we’re surrounded by blue from nature? Whether it’s the ocean or the blue
sky? Maybe it invokes feelings of comfort because we see it so much.

What are your thoughts? What color is your logo and why?
