<p>Gary V. says, “<a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/78887853/legacy-is-greater-than-currency">Legacy is more valuable than
currency</a>.” 
I couldn’t agree more. You should act in order to fulfill your legacy,
not attain currency.  When it comes down to screwing over a customer for
profit, it’s not worth it.  Instead, give that customer exceptional
service even if doing so costs profits.  In the end, people will
remember what you did rather than the commodity you sold them.  That
mindshare will circulate and come back tenfold in returning customers
and positive regard.  Not to mention the great feeling you get inside
when you genuinely help someone.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://reflect7.com">Reflect7</a> has discussed a <a href="http://loudjet.com/a/learning-pains">directional
change</a>. We’ve been
entertaining the idea of dropping our Sports Apps and moving directly
towards our main goal: to have a positive impact on the world.  The
first step is to build a book sharing website dubbed Mindspread.  I’ve
taken the position that we should work out the Sports Apps kinks and
then tackle Mindspread.  I don’t want us to abandon the Apps because
they bring in revenue that can go towards bootstrapping us later.</p>
<p>Attending to the Sports Apps would delay Mindspread development by a few
months.  During the discussion, my partners have quoted Jason Fried’s,
“<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/72-inspiration-is-magical">Inspiration is
perishable</a>.” 
I’ve addressed that position
<a href="http://loudjet.com/a/inspiration-is-not-perishable">here</a>.
They’ve also quoted Gary V, “Legacy is more valuable than currency.”  My
good buddies believe that we should scrap the apps and get right to our
Legacy.  But now we’re muddying the vernacular waters.  Legacy is not
purpose; it’s not some specialized goal.  <strong>Legacy is the context in how
others view you regardless of your goal.</strong>  You can’t “act” on a
Legacy.  You act on your goal and your legacy is the way you go about
achieving that goal.<strong> </strong>Did you do it with respect, empathy, and
integrity?  or did you grovel for everything you could get no matter
what the cost? </p>
<p>The base of the discussion should not have been legacy, but what our
primary goal was. Then we should have extrapolated the baby goals that
we needed in order to reach our main goal.</p>
<p>​1) Our main goal is to have a positive impact on the world</p>
<pre><code>a) One baby step to get to that goal is to free up all of our time</code></pre>
<p>(aka bootstraping) to work towards goal #1</p>
<p>Let’s face it.  If we’re all working for the man, there’s not much time
to create a giant impact on the world.  Time is the most valuable
commodity.</p>
<p>Let’s look at it another way.  I’m a digger and my goal is to dig a
giant tunnel.  After digging with my hands for several days someone
comes along and says, “Hey, if you build a shovel then you’ll dig much
faster.”  Is building a shovel wavering from my goal?  Nope.  It’s
switching my focus to a tool that will help me complete my goal with
greater efficiency.  In this same way, revenue from the apps is a tool
to achieving bootstrapping. </p>
<p>If we want to maintain a strong legacy then I suggest that do what’s
right by our 120,000+ customers and keep the Sports Apps alive by
committing to 40 more hours of work.  Lately, we’ve received 5-7 emails
from angry customers who want updated data for a Football season that
hasn’t even begun.  Imagine the animosity once they realized we’ve
abandoned the apps (if we do).  The argument can be made that since we
are eventually going to relinquish the apps in 2-3 years, then why not
just get the customer pain over with now instead of waiting for it to
build up.  I have two answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m taking back my decision that we should ever get rid of the
Sports Apps. Yeah I know, it’s a bitch move but I need a mulligan
here.  In 2-3 years, if we’ve reached our goal then we will be a
company that is up and running with employees.  If the apps have a
large, active, customer base then we can have our employees maintain
them.  Look at any software company that has multiple software
apps.  There’s always a burn rate with growth when it comes to
hiring on people who can maintain that software.  Our mindset should
be to reduce the maintenance so much that it will only need a light
touch every season.</li>
<li>If we decide to jettison the Sports Apps later then at least we can
formulate a viable transition strategy.  Right now we’d just be
throwing them in the dumpster and disappointed thousands of
customers.  That’s not the legacy I want to start with.  I’d much
rather phase them out by giving our customers months notice to the
transition.  Maybe we can hand them off to another company/our
competition.  Since most apps will probably be free by that time,
I’m sure our competition wouldn’t mind getting thousands of more
eyeballs on their iads.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way you slice it, if we have a customer base that is large enough
to worry about, then the product is still viable as long as we can
minimize the upkeep.  Since we can’t tell the future, let’s look to the
past.  Our efforts to maintain these apps (after they’re up and running)
hasn’t been more than 45 minutes a week.  After we go through this 40
hour tweak, the apps will be much more robust.  This is the last 10% and
it’s time to buck up.  Not just for our bootstrapping future but to
preserve our Legacy.</p>
